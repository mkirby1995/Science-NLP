OPTICAL ASSEMBLY CONFIGURATION CONCEPTS
Several options are being traded:
· Conventional optical design, reduced in dimensions as much as possible · Beam-pointing would be accomplished with the aid of a two-axis fast steering mirror
· An array of laser transmitters and receivers behind a transmit/receive aperture · Beam pointing would be accomplished by activating a specific laser in the array
· A near-monolithic optical system using holographic optical elements · Beam pointing would be accomplished via a two-axis fast steering mirror

Beam Pointing Assembly Concept For Lasercom
· Assumed to be body-mounted · No coarse pointing gimbal · Spacecraft would coarse point the terminal to about 3 to 9 mrad (for telecom, deep-space spacecraft typically point the RF antenna to <3 mrad) (9 mrad ~0.5°)
· Incorporates a 1° (17.5 mrad) class field-of-view (FOV) camera that could acquire an Earth beacon laser signal in the presence of the 3-9 mrad disturbance (peak-to-peak) · A 1000 pixel CCD array, for example, would have a FOV of 17 milli-radians
· With adequate beacon signal signal-to-noise ratio, should be able to centroid to 1/10th pixel accuracy
· Depending on the disturbance spectrum of the platform, an FSM would be incorporate into the flight system to keep the downlink beam pointed back to Earth with mis-point of 10-20 micro-radian (i.e. 3-6 micro-rad rms)

Lens/immersion medium

Overview
The spectrometer is a miniaturized version of the compact Dyson design form that is currently under development at JPL and elsewhere. Our work will extend our concept from the PRISM airborne spectrometer, tested in early 2012, and a fast, wide-field imaging spectrometer demonstrated as a laboratory breadboard through NASA's PIDDP program.

Detector

· Detector similar to the one flown on PRISM (Portable Remote Imaging Spectrometer)

· Data processing based on a heritage design

· Consumes ~1W of average power

· Detector interface and data storage

*Proposed Mission

Pre-decisional ­ for planning and discussion purposes only

Proposed  Mission  Overview  
Why Asteroids? Important targets for understanding: · Presolar processes recorded in the materials of
primitive bodies · Condensation, accretion, and other formative
processes in the solar nebula Effects and timing of secondary processes on the evolution of primitive bodies · Assess the nature and chronology of planetesimal differentiation. Targets of interest for future human exploration

Large Number of Near Earth Asteroids (NEA) CubeSat approach to NEA exploration could enable a program of inexpensive exploration of a large number of diverse NEA.

Measurement Approach Close flybys of Near Earth Asteroid
(NEA) with spacecraft imaging spectrometer to map surface mineralogy at geologic scales. Data collected then stored on board and returned to Earth post-encounter.

Example infrared spectra of the materials in the meteorite Allende from Sunshine et al. 2008.

The  world  is  ready  for  Interplanetary  CubeSats.  
· Interplanetary CubeSats could perform a wide variety of exciting missions at much lower cost than today's Solar System exploration missions, but with much narrower scope per mission.
· Interplanetary CubeSats are much more challenging than "typical" LEO CubeSats, but the required technologies and skill sets are developing for the first steps beyond Earth.
· Scientists who would like to use the new capability are excited.
· Institutions that can provide the new capability are excited.
· Continuing technology investments could yield a broad and rapid increase in the community of institutions having the capability to perform affordable, independent science investigations in interplanetary space.
· NASA could enable dramatic new capability by making launch slots and funding available to support CubeSats on all launches to C3 >~0, and as hosted riders aboard some fraction of geostationary satellites.
