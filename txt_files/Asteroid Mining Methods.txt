Preliminary Requirements Analysis

· Mining
­ Fragmentation ­ Moving / hauling ­ Separation ­ Melting ­ Containment ­ Processing

· Planetary Defense
­ Fragmentation ­ Moving / hauling ­ Containment ­ Separation

Note level of commonality between mining and planetary defense Also note that this list is notional - more work is needed to capture a complete set of systems requirements and constraints
Saturday, November 20, 2010

First-order Constraints
· Astrodynamics
­ Manifolds vs. Hohmann transfers ­ Earth-Moon vs. Earth-Sun Lagrange points destination
· Environmental conditions
­ Very low gravity, variable gravity vector ­ High vacuum ­ Hard radiation ­ Thermal cycling ­ Available sunlight & diurnal cycle
· Launch systems (payload mass & volume) · Available energy (power sources) · Maintenance & Repair (service life) · Communication delays · Other system constraints will likely be identified as
asteroid exploration and development advances...

Required first Simultaneous

Process steps, cont'd
· Principles of terrestrial mining include
­ Max productivity + revenues ­ Min costs + need for reclamation ­ Actions that lower risk are typical ­ Low maintenance / complexity technology is often preferred over
higher productivity (perception of longer service life)
· Mine design process
­ Planning and sequencing of unit operations in time and 3D space
­ Extract the mineral of interest at the maximum net benefit (total benefits minus costs)
­ The capabilities required to make the mining method work are the first-order determinants
­ Mining methods are refined to the second and third orders by the constraints imposed by the technology choices made
Saturday, November 20, 2010

Developing Mining Methods for Asteroids

· Types of mining methods:
­ Classified by fragmentation energy storage
· Self-supporting · Artificially supported
· Caving
­ Classified by access
· Surface · Underground
­ Classified otherwise
· Spin-assisted · Others?

· Mining method selection
­ Market (output) controls
· Demand rate · Location
­ Geologic (input) controls
What to produce? Who's buying it?
The answers determine the mining method

Saturday, November 20, 2010

Asteroid mining methods
· Notional asteroid mining methods proposed in the literature can be abstracted into various categories
­ Bag & Boil => volatile extraction ­ Magnetic Rake => collect high grade ore ­ Divide & Deliver => take a smaller piece home ­ New Moon => put into earth orbit ­ Hot Knife => cut up a comet core with nuclear heat ­ Inside-out => remake it in your own image ­ Mosquito => remove the good stuff from under the shell ­ Laser torch => divide & conquer ­ Etc.
· Operational experience will determine which methods work (all of the above are theoretical at best)
· Note: There is a strong dependence between mining method and ore type / geomechanical properties...

Unit Operations
· The concept of "unit operations" is used in the mining industry to describe elements in the process that connects a pristine mineral occurrence to a deliverable commodity
· Elements of mining Unit Operations include
­ Resource Assessment ­ Determines what is available, where it is, what form it is in, and how it can best be extracted
­ Resource Extraction ­ provides raw materials from the local environment by removing them, concentrating them, and preparing them for further processing, manufacturing, or direct use
­ Resource Acquisition ­ Separates and removes the target raw material -- gas, liquid, and/or solid -- from its original location to Resource Beneficiation
­ Resource Beneficiation ­ Converts the raw material into a form suitable for direct use, manufacturing, or further processing
­ Site Management ­ Comprises supplemental capabilities needed for
Saturday, November 20, 2010

Capability analysis
· Several technologies usually can be applied to achieve the same capability
· Drilling example (all create access to rock at depth)
­ mechanical excavation
· down-the-hole hammer drilling · top-hammer drilling
­ chemical drilling ­ laser drilling ­ nuclear drilling ­ gnomes with picks and shovels...
Saturday, November 20, 2010

Current Mining Capabilities
· Some in-space capabilities have already been demonstrated:
­ Scooping of regolith samples on the Moon and Mars. ­ Coring & drilling of regolith samples on the Moon. ­ Grinding and analysis of rock samples on the Moon and Mars. ­ Mars atmosphere capture and separation ­ Cryo-coolers demonstrated on satellites for long duration (Mars
conditions).
· Present capabilities of terrestrial resource extraction include:
­ Semi-automated drilling/boring, fragmentation, excavation, and transportation of rock, both underground and on the surface.
­ Semi-automated pre-processing of gases, liquids, and solids into forms suitable for further processing, manufacturing, or direct use.
­ Production rates from a few liters/day to 200,000+ tonnes/day. ­ Successful operations:
· from 4,600 m elevation to 3,800 m depth in the crust, and on the sea bottom; · in locations accessible only when the ground freezes, when it thaws, or

Asteroid Mining Gaps and Risks
· Gaps:
­ Products and target materials ­ better definition required ­ Extraction method depends on detailed resource information ­ Extraction and beneficiation also depend on detailed product specifications ­ Current data useful only for prospecting ­ better resolution required ­ Unknown mass/mission constraints ­ precise architecture required ­ Lunar and martian granular materials behavior poorly understood ­ Effects of lunar and martian environments on equipment technologies ­ Required capabilities are common to all environments ­ Only the technologies needed to achieve these capabilities vary
· Risks:
­ Prospecting uncertainty ­ Economic uncertainty (no current customers exist) ­ Systems reliability and costs ­ Effects asteroidal environmental conditions ­ Political and legal uncertain (e.g., property rights) ­ Terrestrial experience in resource extraction is broad and deep, but translating
Saturday, November 20, 2010

Planetary Defense Synergies
· Flood control analogy
­ Dams are built by USACE to avert floods ­ Power-generation and recreational facilities created by the
impoundments provide benefits ­ Example of converting a hazard into a resource
· Asteroid mining could simultaneously de-threaten a PHA orbit while providing resources for space exploration
­ Public / private partnerships could leverage government resources with private capital
­ Partnership could extend limited liability to the private party and return valuable civil engineering data (dynamics of moving an asteroid)
­ Could help initiate a `space gold rush'

Mining for Planetary Defense
· Example asteroids classified:
· Controlled fragmentation process 
­ explosives emplacement needs R&D ­ resource extraction possible concurrently but is not the main focus
Saturday, November 20, 2010

Physical Classification of Asteroids for Mining & Planetary Defense
· Size Axis:
­ Class 1. Requires only one blast of a few to several hundred charges. A single human-robotic team is needed for blast design and construction.
­ Class 2. Requires between two and 20 simply layered blasts. One to several teams are needed, depending on the mitigation speed required.
­ Class 3. Requires more than 20 blasts, with significant complexity, including multiple layers of blasts. Many human-robotic teams needed.
· Composition Axis:
­ Group 0. Ice composites ­ very weak, containing ices with or without organic compounds.
­ Group 1. Friable rock ­ similar to Group 0, but with no volatile components. Also weak.
­ Group 2. Hard rock ­ strong and brittle, the most similar to materials encountered in terrestrial mining and excavation practice.
­ Group 3. Metallic:
· 3a. Massive metal ­ may be ductile. · 3b. Rock-metal composites ­ would fracture mainly at rock-metal interfaces.

Conclusions
· Partner planetary defense with asteroid ISRU
­ Begin a comprehensive, ongoing missions program to characterize PHAs:
· Measure properties pertinent to mining and defense
­ destruction and deflection can be designed for simultaneously
· Return samples for detailed analysis · Build and maintain robust database of PHA traits
­ follow and improve on the USGS model with modern information technology
· A partnership between planetary defense and asteroid mining would be enabling for both
­ Certain PHAs may be excellent resource choices ­ Many common knowledge requirements exist ­ Many common technologies and capabilities apply ­ Detailed engineering analysis and design is warranted
· Knowledge should include mining, aerospace and astrodynamics · Trade studies should include detailed analysis of technical
requirements and constraints as well as economic forecasting
