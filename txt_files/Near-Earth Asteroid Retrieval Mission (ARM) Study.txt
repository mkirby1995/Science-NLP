The Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) concept brings together the capabilities of the science, technology, and the human exploration communities on a grand challenge combining robotic and human space exploration beyond low Earth orbit. This paper addresses the key aspects of this concept and the options studied to assess its technical feasibility. Included are evaluations of the expected number of potential targets, their expected discovery rate, the necessity to adequately characterize candidate mission targets, the process to capture a non-cooperative asteroid in deep space, and the power and propulsion technology required for transportation back to the EarthMoon system. Viable options for spacecraft and mission designs are developed. Orbits for storing the retrieved asteroid that are stable for more than a hundred years, yet allow for human exploration and commercial utilization of a redirected asteroid, are identified. The study concludes that the key aspects of finding, capturing and redirecting an entire small, near-Earth asteroid to the Earth-Moon system by the first half of the next decade are technically feasible. The study was conducted from January 2013 through March 2013 by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in collaboration with Glenn Research Center (GRC), Johnson Space Center (JSC), Langley Research Center (LaRC), and Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC).
I. Introduction NASA has conducted studies on the exploitation of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) since the 1970s,1-5 but the propulsion required to transport large amounts of mass or entire small asteroids back to the EarthMoon system had remained an unresolved challenge, and a wide variety of propulsion concepts were considered.6-8 In 2010 NASA conducted a study that considered the feasibility of using of near-term, high-power (~40-kW) Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) to rendezvous with a small NEA (with a mass of order 10 t), capture it, and return it to the International Space Station.9,10 Based in part on this 2010 study the Keck Institute for Space Studies (KISS) at the California Institute of Technology, and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) jointly sponsored a study in 2011-2012 on the feasibility of capturing and returning a somewhat larger, but still very small NEA (with a mass of up to ~1000 t) to translunar space. The study included participants from six NASA centers, eight universities, commercial companies, and others. The results of that study are described in several conference papers11-14 and the study's final report.15 It was based on this report that NASA chartered a three-month study in 2013 with the primary objective of looking at the asteroid retrieval mission concept in sufficient depth to determine if its feasibility would stand up to more detailed scrutiny. The study was conducted from January 2013 through March 2013 by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in collaboration with the Glenn Research Center (GRC) and supported by Johnson Space Center (JSC), the Langley Research Center (LaRC), and the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). It is the results of the three-month study that are summarized in this paper.

There are three key parts to the overall asteroid redirect mission: 1. An observation campaign to identify a sufficient number of potential targets around which a viable
mission implementation plan can be developed and executed. 2. A robotic asteroid redirect vehicle with sufficient on-board propulsion capability to rendezvous
with, capture, and redirect a near-Earth asteroid with a mass up to 1000 t to translunar space in a reasonable flight time. 3. A human spaceflight capability that can rendezvous with the returned asteroid in translunar space in order to inspect it, study and sample it, to determine its composition and internal structure, and assess its potential for resource utilization.
A. Relevance
This mission fits well into the overarching objectives of the nation's Human Space Program, which is to enable humans to step ever deeper into space and eventually to Mars. Exploration of a captured asteroid is consistent with the capability development framework philosophy and could be a first step to using new capabilities (SLS and Orion) already under development. Additionally, the high-power SEP and solar array technologies are essential for future human exploration missions beyond low-Earth orbit.16-25
To find suitable targets for this mission the current asteroid observational campaign will be enhanced. These enhancements will live on beyond the target selection for ARM and extend discovery and characterization of the current observational programs to include smaller asteroids. The capture, return, and close-up inspection of the asteroid would provide insight into the ability to control and deflect a large mass helping to inform future planetary defense measures. The methodologies and technologies developed to rendezvous with, capture and control a tumbling asteroid can be used in Earth orbit to rendezvous and capture large pieces of orbital debris.
While not a science mission, the delivery of an entire small near-Earth asteroid to an accessible lunar orbit would allow scientists to retrieve and examine, in detail, bulk composition of the captured target, furthering our understanding of the formation of the solar system.
The captured asteroid could also provide opportunities for the commercial sector, which has recently expressed interest in mining asteroids. Sampling techniques and potentially in situ resource utilization (ISRU) demonstrations would path-find future applications. The demonstration of high-power solar arrays and high-power electric propulsion systems would support U.S. competitiveness in the commercial satellite industry.
II. Mission Concept Overview and Mission Design
The asteroid redirect mission concept uses a robotic spacecraft equipped with a high power, solar electric propulsion (SEP) system to rendezvous with, capture, and redirect a small asteroid with a mass of up to 1000 t to a long-term stable lunar orbit. An overview of the mission concept is given in Figure 1. The electric propulsion subsystem, with a nominal input power of 40 kW, enables the asteroid redirect vehicle (ARV) to be launched using a single Atlas V-class launch vehicle or a heavy lift launch vehicle such as the Space Launch System (SLS) or Falcon Heavy. For the Atlas V-class launch, the SEP system is used to spiral out from an initial elliptical Earth orbit to a Lunar Gravity Assist (LGA) in approximately one to one and a half years. The LGA boosts the ARV to escape from the Earth-Moon system and starts it on its heliocentric transfer to the asteroid. The heliocentric transfer of two to three years (depending on the target) is then completed using the SEP system resulting in rendezvous with the asteroid. The more capable SLS and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles can launch the ARV on trajectories directly to the LGA eliminating the Earth-spiral phase, shortening the total mission flight time by one to one and a half years, and simplifying the flight system and mission design.

The technical trade space considered in this study is show in Fig. 3. The three highlighted options were selected for detailed study to assess how well they balanced complexity, total cost, cost risk, technology return (extensibility, infusion), and technical risk across mission elements. Feasibility at this early stage of concept definition requires the establishment of appropriate technical margins throughout the flight system (especially mass and power). These margins are shown in Table 4 for Option 2 from Fig. 3.

B. Asteroid Redirect Vehicle (ARV)
The ARV would be composed of two modules, as indicated in Fig. 4, to enable parallel development, assembly, and testing: a Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) Module, and a Mission Module. The Mission Module would be comprised of an Avionics Module, sensor suite, and the capture mechanism. The SEP Module would include all of the power and propulsion for the ARV, and the Avionics Module would include all other spacecraft bus functions.
1. The SEP Module
The asteroid redirect mission concept would be enabled by high-power solar electric propulsion. Solar electric propulsion missions always show better performance at higher power levels and this mission is no different. Mission design trade studies indicate that the best combination of asteroid mass and flight times are obtained at the highest power levels. The study, therefore, selected the highest solar array power level that could reasonably be available for launch in this decade. That corresponds to about 50 kW, which is the upper end of the 30-kW to 50-kW range of power levels currently under development in the two Solar Array System (SAS) development activities sponsored by NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD). A 50-kW solar array beginning-of-life at 1 AU would enable operation of a 40-kW electric propulsion system and the spacecraft at end-of-life with appropriate margins. The 40-kW input power would be processed by multiple, magnetically shielded Hall thrusters operating in parallel with a specific impulse of 3,000 s. Because the asteroid redirect mission is enabled by these technologies it is an ideal platform to meet the needs of STMD's SEP Technology Demonstration Mission. The asteroid redirect mission would demonstrate deployment and operation of a new class of large lightweight, highspecific-power, flexible-blanket solar arrays in space along with the operation of a high-power, highperformance electric propulsion system. The flight configurations of the ARV are shown in Figs. 5 and 6 for the two SAS solar array technologies, ROSA and MegaFlex. The asteroid redirect mission is compatible with either solar array technology.

Figure 5. ARV flight configuration pictured with the MegaFlex solar arrays.
Figure 6. ARV flight configuration pictured with ROSA solar arrays.
The conceptual ARV configuration is dominated by the need to be able to store up to 12 metric tons of xenon. This is significantly greater than the 0.43 t of xenon launched on the Dawn mission, which is the largest xenon propellant load launched to date. Commercial communication satellite manufacturers typically launch only a few hundred kilograms of xenon used for orbit raising and station keeping maneuvers. Consequently, there are no existing tanks that meet the needs of the asteroid redirect mission, so a new tank development is required. The study team identified a solution that minimizes the development risk and cost and provides the lightest tank mass. This approach uses a composite overwrapped pressure vessel with a seamless aluminum liner design made using existing industry manufacturing techniques.
2. Hall thruster stuff
The electric thruster is an enabling element of the ion propulsion subsystem. The feasibility study evaluated a number of candidate thrusters, some currently under development and some that have already flown, for their applicability to ARM. Three key features dictate the thruster evaluation: specific impulse, maximum input power, and propellant throughput capability. If the power level per thruster is too low or if the xenon throughput capability per thruster is too low, then the number of thrusters required becomes excessive. If we consider a 40-kW electric propulsion system with 10 t of xenon, consisting of three thrusters plus one spare, then each thruster/PPU string must operate at 13.3 kW and have a propellant throughput capability of 3400 kg. There are no existing thrusters that have this combination of characteristics along with the ability to operate a specific impulse of 3000 s. Two laboratory model Hall thrusters bracket this capability, the magnetically shielded version of the H6 with the designation H6MS36

and the NASA 300M thruster.37 The

feasibility study assumed the development of

a new 12.5-kW Hall thruster that incorporated

the best design features of the H6MS and

300M thrusters. The thruster development

would be done jointly with an industrial

partner who would then design and fabricate

the flight thrusters.

A long-life, 12.5-kW, 3000-s Hall thruster

represents the cutting-edge of Hall thruster

technology. Computer modeling of the

erosion processes in a magnetically shielded

Hall thruster operating at 3000 s suggested

that even at the 800 V required for this

specific impulse level magnetic shielding

should be effective at suppressing the key

wear-out failure mechanism, i.e., erosion of

the insulator rings that line the annular

discharge chamber region where the ions are produced and accelerated.38 To increase confidence that the computer modeling was correct, the STMD technology program

Figure 7. NASA's H6MS magnetically-shielded Hall thruster operating at 9 kW with a specific impulse of 3,000 s.

performed a 115-hour test at JPL with the

H6MS thruster operating at 9 kW and 3000 s (see Figure 7). The results from the 115-hr test suggests that

a 12.5-kW magnetically shielded Hall thruster with a specific impulse of 3000 s could be development with propellant throughput capability well in excess of that required for the ARM.36

3. Capture Mechanism
Multiple options for the capture mechanism were considered and evaluated. A non-rigidized, inflatable capture bag approach was selected for this study to assess feasibility. The capture bag approach effectively deals with the range of asteroid mechanical property uncertainties and would work equally well if the asteroid was a rubble pile or solid rock. Importantly, this concept is testable in a 1-g environment enabling verification and validation of the system before launch.
The capture process itself is dominated by the spin state of the target. At relatively slow spin-rates of < 0.2 rpm (periods > 5 minutes) about one or more axes, the problem is relatively straightforward and small forces, < 0.1 g, are transmitted back to the spacecraft. At spin rates an order of magnitude higher, up to about 2 rpm (spin period of 30 seconds), the problem is more challenging. For this case, the study team identified a feasible approach in which the capture bag is closed tightly around the asteroid over a few minute period. Residual cross-axis spin is managed by force-controlled winches to keep accelerations reflected back to the spacecraft to less than 0.1 g while the RCS thrusters are subsequently used to detumble and then despin the spacecraft/asteroid combination.

4. Avionics Module
To reduce the cost, risk, and schedule for the flight system implementation, flight-qualified, deepspace avionics and sensors were identified that would work well for the asteroid redirect mission. This includes avionics and core flight software from the Soil Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP) project, the Mars Science Laboratory, and a sensor suite that could include instruments derived from the OSIRIS-REx mission. Sensor Suite. The notional sensor suite supports optical navigation, asteroid characterization, and asteroid capture. The following sensors are currently in the ARM reference design: · Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) ­ used for long range optical navigation and mapping of the asteroid

· Feed-forward to potential future human operations at other asteroids or Mars moons (Phobos and Deimos) by providing information on maneuvering, sampling, anchoring, and dust management at a small body.
· Stimulate the discovery and characterization of small NEAs, significantly improving what is known about this population that represents the vast majority of near-Earth objects.
· Through the enhanced discovery campaign needed for ARM, increase the discovery rate of potentially hazardous asteroids.
· Potentially jump-start an in situ resource utilization (ISRU) industry by providing a near-term target for fledgling asteroid mining companies.
Relevance to the Human Space Program
The delivery of up to 1,000-t asteroid to a stable high-lunar orbit would provide a unique, meaningful, and affordable destination for astronaut crews in the next decade. It would provide a destination that could support multiple subsequent missions, and ultimately could be the anchor for the development of a deep-space infrastructure at this location. Such an infrastructure could be devoted, in, part to initially determining how to extract useful materials from the returned asteroid, and ultimately to extracting these materials on a large scale to support human exploration farther out into the solar system. The development of in situ resource utilization (ISRU) techniques at a retrieved asteroid would demonstrate the feasibility of ISRU in general, potentially making it more likely to be adopted for use on the lunar surface and at Mars.
Sending astronauts to the retrieved asteroid in lunar orbit would provide an affordable path to meeting the nation's goal of sending astronauts to a near-Earth object by 2025. This would mark only the second celestial object that humans will have ever come into contact with, and the first human mission beyond low-Earth orbit in 50 years.
Relevance to Science
Space science is not the objective of an asteroid redirect mission. However, it is extremely likely that ground-breaking science would result from the up-close examination of an entire small asteroid. Having access to the entire body, even a small one, could provide information on the effect of space weathering of the surface layers compared to the bulk material. Such information would be synergistic with the surface samples to be returned by OSIRIS-REx. Having access to the entire body should also provide information regarding the internal structure of the body and its homogeneity.
An observation campaign designed to discover a large number of 10-m-class near-Earth objects and characterize a fraction of them would significantly improve the current state of knowledge of this littlestudied, poorly understood population. Such a campaign with its enhancements would also naturally discover an increased number of bigger, potentially hazardous, near-Earth objects.
The development of the SEP system for an asteroid redirect mission would lead directly to significantly improved SEP systems for deep-space robotic science missions. With larger, lighter, less expensive solar arrays and 3000-s Hall thrusters that have effectively unlimited life, more affordable SEP science missions could be developed. These systems would provide capabilities well beyond the Dawn system, significantly reducing flight times, launch costs, and reducing flight system development costs by easing mass and power constraints.
Relevance to the Commercial Sector
The asteroid redirect mission has the potential to impact the commercial interests of the United States. Near-term impacts would result from the development of the advanced, higher power solar arrays and electric propulsion technologies required for ARM that would also benefit U.S. commercial communication satellites. This will facilitate the development of higher power commercial satellites or the use of higher power on medium-sized satellites launched with smaller, less expensive launch vehicles.
By doing something bold, but achievable, NASA could stimulate interest in space science and technology, as it did in the 1960s, to the benefit of the U.S. economy. In the far-term, the ability to exploit

near-Earth asteroid resources could usher in a new economic frontier based on people living and working in space.
Relevance to Planetary Defense and Orbital Debris Removal
Many of the ARM technologies, operational approaches, and systems would be applicable to planetary defense efforts. The ability to efficiently travel to, interact with, and maneuver an asteroid would directly inform efforts for diverting a potentially hazardous near-Earth object (NEO). These include the operational approaches and systems associated with the approach, rendezvous, and station-keeping mission phases of ARM utilizing a low-thrust, high-power SEP spacecraft, as well as interacting with, capturing, maneuvering, and processing the massive amounts of asteroid material. The use of a SEP spacecraft to deliberately alter the orbit of an asteroid is a direct demonstration of a rudimentary planetary defense capability at a small, safe, and affordable scale. However, since a 5-m to 10-m diameter asteroid is much less massive than an Earth-threatening NEO (diameter of 20 m or larger), the systems and techniques developed for ARM will have limited direct application to the deflection of such objects.
The technology developed for and demonstrated by ARM would be directly applicable to removing large pieces of orbital debris. There are many concepts in the literature that would make use of this capability in one fashion or another.
Relevance to International Participation and Cooperation
The asteroid redirect mission and utilization of the asteroid after its delivery to translunar space affords multiple opportunities for international participation and cooperation. International participation in the discovery and characterization of potential ARM targets would be highly beneficial and perhaps essential. There are multiple possibilities for international participation in the implementation of the asteroid redirect vehicle including contributed sensors and components of the flight system. Post-asteroid return, sampling, sample analysis, and material extraction experiments, both on the ground and in space, would also provide opportunities for international cooperation.
Observation Campaign
Analysis of the near-Earth asteroid population along with actual discovery rates of candidate ARM targets suggests that there is reasonable confidence a sufficient number of good targets exist and that the discovery rate of these targets (currently ~2 per year) could be increased by a factor of two to ten. For an ARM launched in 2018, there would be approximately four years in which to find appropriate primary and backup targets. At a discovery rate of 5 good targets per year, the asteroid redirect mission could have roughly 20 good targets by 2018.
Mission Design
High fidelity end-to-end, low-thrust trajectory designs were developed, based on asteroid 2009 BD that provide confidence that there will be no show-stoppers for the development of the very high­fidelity trajectories necessary for an actual mission. Lower-fidelity trajectories for twelve other known NEAs were used to estimate the maximum asteroid mass that could be retrieved based on the known orbital characteristics of these NEAs and the assumed capabilities of the ARV configured in this study. Mission design work also established at least one class of stable orbits in the Earth-Moon system. These orbits, known as distant retrograde orbits (DRO), have an orbit altitude relative to the Moon of about 70,000 km, are stable for more than a hundred years, and are accessible by both the ARV with a 1000-t asteroid and by crewed missions using SLS and Orion.
Solar Electric Propulsion
Solar electric propulsion is enabling for the ARM. The required capability represents a significant, but achievable advancement to the state-of-the-art. The ARM SEP system represents an important increase in power level relative to the highest power electric propulsion systems currently flying on commercial communication satellites and the highest power deep-space electric propulsion represented by the Dawn spacecraft. The ARM study team identified an approach that minimizes the development risk of the

electric propulsion components. This approach heavily leverages the ongoing investments by NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate in high-power, light-weight solar array development and advanced Hall thruster technology development. A proof-of-concept test for 115 hours of a 3000-s Hall thruster operating at 9 kW was performed during the study period. This test helped to establish confidence that the recently-developed magnetic shielding technology for Hall thrusters could be extended to 3000-s needed for ARM enabling the development of very long-life thrusters at this specific impulse.
