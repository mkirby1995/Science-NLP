Imagine...
It is the year 2070.
The existing space economy is thriving.
There are many facilities scattered across Cislunar space providing
services to space companies.
Colonies on the Moon and Mars have been running continuously for at least
a decade.
Lunar and asteroid ISRU produce enough surplus material to be
commercialized.
Humans are ready to begin deep space settlement.

In this context, there is a growing demand for a large space facility where multiple space companies can conduct their activities and offer their services, establish their market, and
settle their workers.
This thesis presents one concept for such a facility :
New Venice Multi-Industry Space Outpost
New Venice is a physical address where companies can explore the space environment. They will be able to lease space on-board without the cost and burden of constructing and launching their own space facilities. The community village offers comfortable amenities for the employers and
visitors, and is a popular tourist destination.

Conclusion
Problem 1
How to incorporate micro-gravity in comfortable, stimulating living environments, breaking free from the usual concepts of either adapting Earth to space or Humans to machines?
· Abandon the minimalistic design approach that provides only the bare minimum for the astronauts.
· Space is a harsh enough environment - the space habitats don't have to be.
· Create large open spaces to allow different internal configurations.
· Create visual diversity by making use of architectural design principles.
· Break monotony in the design by incorporating unusual elements.
· Play with the possibilities - there is no gravity, make use of that!
· Maintain a good balance of private/ public spaces.

Problem 2
How to cater to the great diversity of functions and uses, each with its unique requirements, restrictions and peculiarities without interfering with each other?

Problem 3
How to change the status quo of space station assembly based on chamber-to-chamber/corridor environments?

· Define clear functional allocation to avoid interference.
· Utilize detached modules to avoid direct contact with outpost, but affording shirt-sleeve transfers through pressurized cabs.
· Have module diameter large enough to allow private areas to be closed off.
· Create specific spaces for living/exercise/recreation to keep people off the restricted areas.
· Create clear public pathways through each module.

· Use modules with larger diameter, launch them using new generation rockets such as the SLS.
· Use different types of modules - hard shells, inflatables, hybrids, pressure vessels to allow flexible station configurations.
· Further develop the pressure vessel concept to build in space.
· Further develop the detached module concept to make networks of modules not directly connected to each other.
