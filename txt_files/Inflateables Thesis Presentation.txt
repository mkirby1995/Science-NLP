60° field of view in color mode. From the nominal 50-kilometer (km) polar orbit, the WAC acquires images with a 57-km swath-width and a typical length of 105 km. At nadir, the pixel scale for the visible filters (415­689 nm) is 75 meters (Speyerer and others, 2011). Each month, the WAC provided almost complete coverage of the Moon.

This map was made possible with thanks to NASA, the LRO mission, and the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera team. The map was funded by NASA's Planetary Geology and Geophysics Cartography Program.

PROJECTION
The Mercator projection is used between latitudes ±57°, with a central meridian at 0° longitude and latitude equal to the nominal scale at 0°. The Polar Stereographic projection is used for the regions north of the +55° parallel and south of the ­55° parallel, with a central meridian set for both at 0° and a latitude of true scale at +90° and -90°, respectively. The adopted spherical
Objectives radius used to define the maps scale is 1737.4 km (Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Project Lunar
Geodesy and Cartography Working Group, 2008; Archinal and others, 2011). In projection, the pixels are 100 meters at the equator.

sub-Earth point." The concept of a lunar "sub-Earth point" derives from the fact that the Moon's rotation is tidally locked to the Earth. The actual sub-Earth point on the Moon varies slightly due to orbital eccentricity, inclination, and other factors. So a "mean sub-Earth point" is used to define the point on the lunar surface where longitude equals 0°. This point does not coincide with any prominent crater or other lunar surface feature (Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Project Lunar
Site Geodesy and Cartography Working Group, 2008; Archinal and others, 2011). MAPPING TECHNIQUES

Key Advantages

Key Disadvantages

Proven for space applications, has been selected as metal of choice of Orion capsules. Corrosive resistant.
Lightest structural material. Used when high strength is not necessary, but where a thick, light form is desired, or if higher stiffness is needed.
Does not fatigue, high stiffness, high tensile strength, low weight, high chemical resistance, high temperature tolerance and low thermal expansion, non poisonous, biologically Inert and is a shape-memory polymer, non-corrosive.

Does not take blunt forces well. Medium weight
Temperatures as low as 200 °F (93 °C) produce considerable reduction in the yield strength.
At temperatures above 66°C, carbon fiber resin strength will be reduced. Cannot easily handle Isotrophic force, strength focused on direction of fiber.

Great tension strength, very common aluminum product in aircraft structures. Corrosion resistant. Very wieldable. Verified as stable in ultra-high vacuum chambers.
Corrosion resistance, no exhibit age hardening, nor does it need a precipitation heat treatment to promote hardening. Weldability is good.

Not very strong against brunt forces.
Machinability is only fair to poor.

Wear resistance, Low coefficient of thermal expansion, crack-resistance, class 1 grade material by ESA testing, very high chemical and corrosion resistance, no porosity.

Very new material that hasn't been used in space structurally yet.

Lighter than aluminum based alloys,

Very prone to get rusty, requires resin to protect it. Not a strong tensile material, flamable, not bendable.
