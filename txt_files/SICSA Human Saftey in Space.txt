The Sasakawa International Center for Space Architecture (SICSA), an organization attached to the University of Houston's Gerald D. Hines College of Architecture, offers advanced courses that address a broad range of space systems research and design topics. In 2003 SICSA and the college initiated Earth's first MS-Space Architecture degree program, an interdisciplinary 30 credit hour curriculum that is open to participants from many fields. Some students attend part-time while holding professional employment positions at NASA, affiliated aerospace corporations and other companies, while others complete their coursework more rapidly on a full-time basis.

SICSA routinely presents its publications, research and design results and other information materials on its website (www.sicsa.uh.edu). This is done as a free service to other interested institutions and individuals throughout the world who share our interests.
This report is offered in a PowerPoint format with the dedicated intent to be useful for academic, corporate and professional organizations who wish to present it in group forums. The document is the second in a series of seminar lectures that SICSA has prepared as information material for its own academic applications. We hope that these materials will also be valuable for others who share our goals to advance space exploration and development.

HUMAN ADAPTATION AND SAFETY IN SPACE

PREFACE

This lecture series provides comprehensive information, considerations and examples to support planning of human space missions and facilities:
 Part II (this report) discusses human adaptation and safety influences and requirements that are governed by special mission and environment conditions which relate to topics that are elaborated more in the other three parts :
- Habitat accommodations and logistics support determined by crew size and activities must be correlated with functionality and life support requirements/ constraints imposed by Space Structures and Support Systems (Part I).
- Crew accommodations and logistics as well as safety will be directly impacted by travel time and radiation exposures related Space Transportation, Propulsion and Pathways (Part III).
- All human facility and operations will be driven by planning for Space Mission and facility Architectures (Part IV).

HUMAN ADAPTATION AND SAFETY IN SPACE

CONTENTS

A-1
SECTION A: BACKGROUND

Extreme environments on Earth and in space test human abilities to adapt, survive and undertake difficult/ dangerous tasks: x Hardships include:
-Harsh climate conditions. -Remoteness with restricted access/ return capabilities. -Limitations on available equipment/ support services. -Ever present life-threatening safety risks.
x Space is very different in many respects from human terrestrial environments: -Total dependence on artificial systems. -Altered gravity conditions that affect most activities. -Extreme radiation, temperature and operational conditions. -Stresses related to isolation and confinement.
 To accomplish proper planning we must understand characteristics of space environments: -Reduced gravity levels and their implications. -Radiation hazards and health risks. -The space radiation environment. -The micrometeoroid/ space debris environment. -Special lunar/ Mars environment considerations.
BACKGROUND

A-2
THE NATURE OF SPACE

The transition to near-Earth orbital space:
x Earth's atmosphere is acted upon by 2 principle forces: -Gravity that holds the gaseous envelope in place. -Solar thermal radiation that causes atmospheric gases to expand into surrounding volumes.
x Since these forces remain in relatively constant balance, the atmosphere maintains a distinct vertical density/ pressure profile: -In the outer border of atmosphere ("near-Earth space" ­ about 700 km above the Earth), collisions between air molecules are very rare. -Above this level (the exosphere), free moving air molecules thin out to "true space". (In some zones the density of gas particles in still as high as 1-10 particles per cu. centimeter.)
x The transition zone from Earth's atmosphere into space has 2 points of special interest to spacecraft designers: -At the "von Karman line" (about 80 km), aircraft control surfaces don't function and reaction jets are needed. -At 180-200 km, resistance to air becomes insignificant (represents a mechanical border between the atmosphere and space).
x Inertial and relational forces acting on astronauts enroute to/ from space have important adaptation and design implications: -Acceleration/ deceleration forces cause physiological changes effecting operations and vision. -Weightlessness occurs when the Earth's gravity is exactly counterbalanced by the centripetal force acting on the spacecraft.
BACKGROUND

A-3
Earth's Atmosphere
THE NATURE OF SPACE

As curious creatures, it is our human nature to explore:
x Sometimes exploration is necessary for survival: -To seek new places for hunting. -Seasonal migrations to find food and shelter when weather changes. -Escapes from natural disasters (e.g. floods) and conflicts (wars).
x Sometimes exploration is for new opportunities: -For new resources and commercial trade (Columbus's voyage to America). -For a better place to live (settlement of the US western territories).
x Sometimes exploration is for adventure: -Climbing a mountain "because it is there". -Achieving what has never been done before.
x And sometimes it is done to understand the universe and our place in it: -Sending people beyond previous limits. -Opening our minds beyond previous limits.
BACKGROUND

A-4
WHY GO TO SPACE?

Without exploration humans would still live in caves and trees:
x Exploration forces and teaches us to adapt. -To obtain food and shelter. -To adjust to new environments that are different. -To form new communities and societies. -To be versatile and resourceful.
x Sometimes exploration leads to tragedies: -Challenging "the unknown" can be dangerous. -We don't always find what we expect and are sometimes unprepared for the results.
x But often, the results bring great benefits: -Better understanding of our world . -New ways of doing things. -New technologies for everyday life. -Evolution in our intellectual and cultural development. -Knowledge about human capabilities.

WHY GO TO SPACE?

A-6

Humans first went to space only with their eyes and imaginations: x In 1610 ,the invention of the astronomical telescope
changed humankinds understanding of the universe:
-Galileo Galilei, the great Italian mathematician and astronomer was among the first to use it. x On October 4, 1957 (more than 300 years later) another ancient device (the rocket) was paired with a new device (the spacecraft): -The USSR's Sputnik escaped the Earth's atmosphere and initiated "the space age". x Scientific exploration since that time is providing important information about the early history of our Earth, and perhaps also about its future: -Why did Earth evolve differently than Venus which had similar characteristics in the beginning? -Was there ever life on Mars (and is there still)? -Can life on Earth survive the predicted "greenhouse effect" of global warming (and how can we prevent it)?

WHY GO TO SPACE?

A-7

When John Glenn made the 1st US orbital space flight on February 20, 1962, scientists questioned the ability of humans to survive in space:
x One of his mission objectives was to eat lunch in space to determine: -Would the food go down in weightlessness? -Would it digest properly?
x The 1st astronauts returning from the Moon were quarantined in an air-tight mobile home to see if they had brought back foreign bacteria: -If so, would the bacteria grow? -Would this be an uncontrollable, incurable growth?
x Since then we have learned much about the abilities of humans to live and work in space: -People can function well in weightlessness. -People can eat and digest food naturally. -No alien bacteria have been encountered. -People can work in a productive and versatile manner.

The capability for space habitation has been a key NASA objective since the beginning of the agency:
x The first space voyagers enjoyed few comforts/ amenities: -Mercury astronauts were primarily observers (40 cu. ft. capsules). -Gemini enabled astronauts to pilot spacecraft through complex orbit changes and rendezvous maneuvers (60 cu.ft. capsules)... two very cramped people.
x Apollo Command Modules offered about 4 times the volume of Gemini (240 cu. ft.): -Navigators visually guided spacecraft to safe sites. -Astronauts surveyed the Moon's surface on foot and in rovers, and returned samples.
x After Apollo was completed, an effort was made to apply the hardware for an Earth-orbital lab; Skylab (1969-73): -Skylab was generous in volume (9,950 cu. ft.)... 45 times the volume of Apollo. -The facility provided 2 levels of space... areas for work, sleep, eating and bathing/ personal hygiene. -It was visited by 3 crews (the third mission was 84 days).

Orbiting space stations have been a long-term NASA priority:
x Shortly after Mercury program started (1958), considerations for a small "manned" laboratory began: -During Mercury (1958-63) an orbiting laboratory and lunar mission were leading options for the future. -President Kennedy committed the US to a lunar landing as the national goal for the 1960s. -A space laboratory continued to be studied as a secondary objective, but never got beyond preliminary planning. -While Skylab was underway, new space station concepts continued to be studied, ranging from 6-24 people.
x Following Skylab, the US lagged behind the Soviet Union in orbital space experience: -Soviet stations have supported prime crews of 2 or 3 cosmonauts on much longer missions. -Salyut 6 stayed aloft 4 years and 10 months, hosting 30 cosmonauts (receiving 33 flights of manned and unmanned supply ships). -The Mir space station has been occupied for as long as one year (Vladimir Titov and Musa Manarov).
BACKGROUND

Associated with US space station planning was a "Logistics Vehicle" (which became the Space Shuttle) and a design team headed by Max Faget originated the vehicle concept:
x The Space Station Orbiter is a small, short-term laboratory supporting missions of one week or less: -Two cabin levels provide a total of 2,525 cu. ft. (about 10 times as much as Apollo Command Modules). -The Orbiter sometimes carries a European Space Laboratory in the cargo bay to provide additional habitable volume for life science and other experiments. -It also sometimes carries a "SpaceHab" module for microgravity space processing and other experiments. -Since missions are short, crews are willing to accept cramped quarters with little privacy.
x Since the early 1980's, NASA has led an effort involving Russian, European, Japanese and Canadian partners to create an International Space Station (ISS): -The ISS supports microgravity and life sciences. -Originally planned crew accommodations have been scaled back due to Space Shuttle and budget problems.

Aboard future space outposts there will be new ways of living, working, and perhaps even thinking.
x Previous dashes to the Moon have been similar to expeditions to the North and South poles early in this century: -They have involved marathon endurance runs. -While not lacking in courage, ingenuity and productive results, they have lacked permanence.
x US and Russian space station missions have demonstrated that humans can adapt to space for long periods of time: -US Skylab astronauts lived and worked in space for as long as 84 days. -Russian cosmonauts have lived in space for a year.
x Human missions to Mars are likely to require that people be able to survive and perform in space over periods of years: -Crews must adapt and perform under weightless or artificial-g conditions in transit, and partial-g on the surface.
-They must be protected from radiation and other hazards.

LIVING IN SPACE

Humans in space have evolved from observers (Mercury); to pilots (Gemini); to explorers (Apollo); to workers/ scientists (Skylab). Next may come colonists on much longer missions (Moon and Mars):
x Future crews may be different from previous ones: -Selection may be mixed (gender, age, profession and culture). -They may be less tolerant to difficulties/ inconveniences (a shift away from "the right stuff" mentality).
x Good "habitability" design will be essential: -To influence how effectively/ safely tasks are accomplished. -To influence how thoroughly/ rapidly crews adapt. -To influence how they feel about their surroundings and peers. -To influence how healthy they remain over time.
x To provide good habitability/ human factors design, we must understand the space environment, including: -Influences of zero, artificial and partial gravity. -Environmental issues influencing safety and operations. -Psychological and social issues affecting crew relationships, morale and performance. -Ways to optimize habitat utilization, comfort and safety features.
BACKGROUND

A-12
THE HUMAN FACTOR

A-13

Human factors planning and design addresses ways to integrate the crew with the spacecraft environment, equipment and operations in order to optimize health, morale, performance and safety:
x Interfaces between people and functional systems: -Equipment systems that enable convenient and efficient operations, maintenance and repairs. -Information systems and software for effective decision-making, fault detection and responses. -Stowage and inventory systems to accommodate needed supplies, equipment spares and tools. -Control devices that reflect a good understanding of changes in body posture, leverage and other conditions imposed by weightlessness or reduced gravity.
x Habitat living/ work accommodations: -Features and amenities that have a positive influence upon crew adaptation, comfort and use of surroundings. -Provision for privacy, hygiene, recreation, social activities, exercise and other basic needs.
BACKGROUND

Crew members can be viewed as human systems: x Sensors (eyes, ears and touch). x Mechanical actuators (fingers, arms and legs). x Self-propulsion (walking or push-off floating). x On-board processing (brain). x Communications (voice, gestures and device
actuators). x Emergency response (mechanical/ electrical
interfaces).
Human systems require special support accommodations: x Maintenance (sleep, hygiene, medical & exercise). x Fuel (food and water). x Operating environment (atmosphere & thermal
control). x Sanitation (waste treatment and contaminate
protection). x Environmental safety (space radiation and debris). x Visual enhancements (lighting, windows and
displays). x Functional enhancements (restraints and mobility
aids).
THE HUMAN FACTOR

A-14

A "habitable" environment is one that enables people to readily adapt to unique space conditions, maintain physiological and psychological well-being, achieve high performance levels over time, and be protected from health safety hazards:
x Design must respond to requirements imposed by the space environment: -Gravitational influences in orbit, transit and on a lunar/ planetary surface. -Special radiation and debris exposures requiring special safeguards.
x Design must respond to requirements imposed by the space mission and transportation systems: -Habitat dimension, volume and mass constraints imposed by launch, transfer and landing/ reentry vehicles. -Crew size, activities and mission duration influencing operational and support needs.

SECTION B: INFLUENCES OF WEIGHTLESSNESS ON DESIGN AND ADAPTATION

B-2

Weightless conditions in space have many important influences on habitat design and operations:
x Requires reexamination of nearly everything we take for granted on Earth: - Vertical references are established by design, not by Earth orientation ("up" and "down" are relative). -Full 3-D interior volume can be used for activities. -Mobility is easy but anchorage is the problem. -Body posture is altered to a neutral buoyancy position, but the torso becomes longer. -The reach envelope increases (no center of gravity limitations). -"Heavy" equipment can be moved easily, but may be difficult to stop due to mass inertia.
x Zero-g influences design in many ways: -Ceilings, walls and floors are interchangeable. -People can float in all directions, but anchorage is needed. -Storage must avoid the "Jack-in-a-box" effect. -Horizontal surfaces on tables are arbitrary. -Chairs aren't needed (no gravity to hold the body bent). -People can sleep in any orientation.
WEIGHTLESS CONDITIONS

Operational Influences
DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

Body posture is altered significantly under weightless conditions:
x Physiological changes:
-Without gravity to compress the spinal chord, the human torso elongates a few inches, but is not as stiffly erect as on Earth.
-Sitting in standard chairs is uncomfortable, requiring constant tensing of stomach muscles to keep bodies bent.
x Posture changes: -The relaxed state of bodies unstressed by gravity tends to mimic a fetal position :torso curved concavely; head angled slightly downward; legs extended slightly in front; body bent at hips and knees; feet pointed downward; and arms floating out in front.
-Tables and other work surfaces should be positioned at crouching heights of users (and can be tilted since items placed on top must be secured to keep them from drifting away).

Weightless conditions present special operational advantages and disadvantages:
x Habitat volume utilization efficiencies: -Ceiling areas can be easily accessed for workplaces, stowage, outside viewing and other functions to optimize habitat capacity. -Sleeping quarters/ accommodations can be oriented vertically to conserve useful floor areas.
x Locomotion and lifting benefits: -Floating with a push-off is a rapidly achieved skill that enables easy movement in all directions. -Massive elements can be moved and manipulated without effort for logistics transfer, equipment maintenance/ repairs and other activities.
x Leverage and anchorage disadvantages: -Astronauts require handholds and other body restraints to perform activities requiring arm torque force and stationary work task positioning. -Means are required to prevent equipment, tools and other items from floating away.
WEIGHTLESS CONDITIONS

Functional Advantages/Constraints
DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

B-6

Crew adaptation to weightlessness can be facilitated by responsive human factors design:
x Interior layouts and visual cues: -Spatial references are essential to prevent confusion in areas occupied by multiple individuals positioned above/ below each other in varying body orientations. -Colors and graphics can establish floor, wall and ceiling "local vertical" references. -Graphic information should be designed for easy comprehension in different orientations.
x Locomotion techniques and safeguards: -Most exposed spacecraft surfaces and equipment are used as push-off points. -Care must be taken to avoid design of fragile devices that can be kicked by floating astronauts, open switches that can be bumped and exposed items that can cause electrical shocks and burns. -Sharp corners on equipment should be avoided to prevent bruises and laceration injuries.

A variety of anchorage devices are often needed to secure people and loose items in place.

x Foot restraint systems:
-Skylab crews inserted cleats on their shoes into triangular grid openings in floors.

-Simple loop straps have been tried, but feet tend to slip out too easily.

-Suction cups and Velcro have proven too weak to contain strong leg muscle forces effectively.
-Devices similar to ski bindings offer possibilities, but have not yet been successfully demonstrated.

Foot Restraint Concept Sleeping Bag/Restraint

x Item stowage and attachment devices:
-Velcro and bungee chords have found popular use for temporary and makeshift means to secure small equipment, tools and other items.

-Hang-up type soft stowage systems with transparent content viewing pockets offer promising solutions for clothing, hygiene supplies and other personal items.

WEIGHTLESS CONDITIONS

DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

B-8

Long-term exposure to weightless conditions have important effects on the human body:

x Calcium loss from bones: -Continues to occur throughout the flight. -Bones can't repair themselves as they do in normal gravity, and become brittle.

x Muscular/ cardiovascular deconditioning: -Reduced effort leads to loss of muscle mass and atrophy. -Effects are influenced by flight length and the amount of exercise activity.

Loss of Bone Density

Fluid Shifts/Blood Cell Loss

x Fluid shifts and blood loss: -Body fluids move upward into chest and head areas causing bloating. -The total quantity of fluids (including blood) is reduced, causing dehydration .

x Space adaptation (sickness) syndrome: -Nausea can occur during first hours/ days (partly due to otolith canals in inner ears).

Muscle/Heart Deconditioning

Neurosensory Disturbances

-Affects about half of all people who go to space.

Exercise to counteract muscle and cardiovascular deconditioning was practiced on Skylab missions, and will be even more important for longer lunar/ planetary voyages:
x Recent mission experiences: -The exercise program on Skylab was considered to be successful; the Skylab 4 crew returned after 84 days in good physical condition. -Adherence to active exercise programs on longer Mir missions was not clearly documented. -Soviet cosmonauts sometimes used "penguin suits" consisting of trousers with elastic cords to maintain tension on leg muscles.
x At least 1-2 hours of exercise are believed necessary to maintain good muscle/ cardiovascular health: -Typical devices include bicycle ergonometers and treadmills, as well as vacuum equipment that produces a negative relative pressure around legs to stress the heart. -Exercise on machines tends to be boring, suggesting the need for incorporating some forms of entertainment such as TV displays. -Accommodations for two or more people to exercise at one time can facilitate work schedules and conversations.

Weightless conditions can produce disturbing spatial orientation and cognitive problems:
x Zero-g inversion illusions:
-A sensation of feeling continuously upside down (reported from US and Russian experiences).
-Continues even after eyes are closed.
-Attributed to combined effects of gravitational unloading of inner ear otilith organs, elevation of viscera, and fluid shifts.
x Visual reorientation illusions:
-A sensation while floating that floors, ceilings and walls change identities.
-A surface below the feet seems like a "floor", and surfaces parallel to the body are "walls".
-The sight of a crewmate floating inverted nearby can make one feel upside down.
-Earth viewed through a window or on an EVA spacewalk can provide a powerful "down".

x Disoriented element recognition difficulties: -Familiar places and objects can be difficult to recognize when viewed from changed orientations. -Information and control systems (including words, graphic displays and switches) may be ambiguous.
x Height vertigo effects: -Looking "down" towards habitat areas below one's feet can produce anxious feelings of falling.
-EVA astronauts viewing Earth below them can be inclined to "hang on for dear life".
x 3-D spatial memory difficulties: -Crew members traversing between space station modules with non-aligned visual local verticals can become lost .
-Some Shuttle crews visiting the Mir Space Station had problems finding their way back.
-These problems can be dangerous during emergencies (particularly when darkness or smoke obscures vision).

Planning and design must take a variety of factors and requirements into account: x Internal equipment layouts and designs:
-Optimum utilization of walls, floors and ceilings with orientation references. -Avoidance of sharp corners/ protrusions that can cause injuries when bumped. -Protection of fragile fixtures and control surfaces that can be bumped. -Design for maintenance procedures that take weightlessness into account.

x Anthropometric and ergonomic factors: -Influences on work surface heights. -Influences on reach envelopes and general task procedures/ performance. -Influences on force requirements and leverage constraints for various tasks.
x Restraints and mobility aids: -Hand-holds, foot and body restraints. -Means to secure loose items.
x Exercise accommodations: -Areas/ equipment to support exercise and monitor health.

Artificial gravity (AG) space vehicles and centrifuge devices are often proposed as countermeasures against detrimental health and performance effects of prolonged weightlessness during missions to Mars and back, including:
x Loss of bone mineral density and associated increases of renal stone risk.
x Muscle atrophy.
x Cardiovascular deconditioning including fluid shifts and blood cell losses.
x Sensory/ neurovestibular alterations including balance and perceptual illusions.
A-g might also provide other benefits:
x Reducing levels of particulate matter suspended in the atmosphere (including microbial and toxic).
x Ergonomic advantages such as materials handling, surgery and excretory functions.

Absent anything to push against, normal gravity, acting alone, produces only a sense of weightlessness. x On Earth, weight is experienced by the upward push of the
ground. x This sensation can also be accomplished using centripetal
acceleration via rotation where: Perceived weight= object mass (M) times simulated gravity level (G) expressed in the formula G=wr2 G= rate of acceleration (ft/sec2) w= spin rate or angular velocity (radian/sec) r= distance radius of body from center of rotation (feet)

Life under A-g conditions will be different than often depicted in science fiction movies and publications.
x Illustrations show travelers passing between A-g and weightlessness unaffected by Coriolis forces or A-g induced illness responses.
x Rotating vehicles often have short radii which would be unacceptable for human comfort, adaptation and performance.
x Long connecting tunnels between central hubs and A-g areas do not consider gravity gradients or the massive pressurized structures that would have to be constructed.

Most A-g research addresses human survivability and adaptation, not optimizing comfort and habitability:
x Fractional A-g levels necessary to support mental and physical health during longduration exploration missions are unclear.
x The minimum-g threshold at which A-g induced sickness can be avoided is also uncertain.
x Abilities of people to adapt movements and activities to A-g conditions so that they become normal and routine is unproven.
x Possible nauseaogenic responses produced by transitions between weightlessness to A-g and back must be determined.

ARTIFICIAL-G CONSIDERATIONS

KEY ISSUES AND QUESTIONS

C-6

Despite experimental research limitations, some physiological consequences of rotational A-g are well documented through ground-based research:
x Head movements made out-of-plane with the rotation vector cause people to experience nauseogenic cross-coupled vestibular stimulation (an illusion of tumbling).
x The magnitude of nausea-producing effects depends upon which way a person is facing relative to the direction of the rotation.
x Coriolis forces deflect a person's limbs in a consistent/ predictable direction depending upon the rotation vector reference.
x Adaptation to these phenomena, particularly when people are moving and changing orientations, may require several days with sea sickness-like discomfort.
x Reentry back to normal-g will require a similar readjustment period.

x Centripetal acceleration between 0.035-1 g, and angular velocity less than 4rpm.

Their paper at the same meeting hosted by NASA JSC Director Robert Gilruth presented different comfort zone conclusions:

x A lower boundary of 0.2 g for locomotion friction with minimum rim speed of 24 ft/sec to avoid weight variations (20% faster than Schnitzer and Hill).

Kramer proposed the following criteria:
x Maximum centripetal acceleration of 1 g.
x Angular velocity less than 3 rpm to avoid motion sickness.
x Coriolis acceleration not to exceed 0.25 times centripetal acceleration for a velocity of 3 ft/sec in the radian direction.
x Gravity gradient should not exceed 0.01 g/ft in the radial direction (6% over 6 ft.).

Provide internal visual references that provide clear and constant awareness of the spin direction for crew orientation using graphic symbols, colors, lighting and other devices.
Orient workstations so that the user's facial plane is parallel to the spin axis to minimize crosscoupled head rotations which can have adverse ear-down effects.

Radial traffic should be kept to a minimum, and crew members should not be required to traverse through the spin axis unless the hub is nonrotating at the time.
Living and work areas should be located as far as possible from the axis of rotation to maximize therapeutic physiological benefits (bone, muscle & cardiovascular fitness).

Design controls and displays so that left-right head rotations can be avoided and up-down arm motions are least necessary (to minimize Coriolis accelerations).

Means should be provided to facilitate crew transitions through gravity gradients as they pass from areas near the center of rotation to A-g destinations.

Orient crew compartments and equipment systems so that primary traffic paths are parallel to the spacecraft's spin axis to avoid locomotion and sensory conflicts.

Ladders oriented along vectors radial to the spin hub should enable one side to be used for ascent and the other for descent to compensate for tangential Coriolis forces.

Concepts for creating rotating spacecraft to produce A-g have been proposed over more than a century:
x Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, one of history's most renowned space visionaries introduced the idea in 1903, influencing the thinking of many others who followed.
x Sergi Korolev, the father of the Soviet Space Program had a technical team that designed a tethered flexible A-g system for the Voskhod manned mission in the early 1960s.
x Werner Von Braun, a great US space leader, proposed a 125 ft. diameter torus spinning at 3 rpm which offered a popular basis for many technical and science fiction visualizations.

Most A-g spacecraft concepts that have been proposed are very preliminary in nature, and fail to address many problematic requirements:
x A-g capabilities will fundamentally drive all design, engineering and operational planning activities, establishing the framework and direction of all subsequent decisions.
x A-g will impose dramatic influences upon program complexity and cost, including fabrication; on-orbit assembly, orbital docking/ transfers, and solar power systems.
x Design for human safety, comfort and operations will present unique challenges, including adaptation to Coriolis forces, glevel transitions, and outside viewing.

Centrifuges are commonly used for A-g research using animals and human subjects, and have also been proposed as partial countermeasures against bone, muscle and cardiovascular deconditioning effects of extended weightless or reduced gravity conditions in space:
"Lazy Susan"- type centrifuges were first proposed and tested at MIT's Man Vehicle Lab during the mid-1980s, and have been used to evaluate human A-g influences and benefits for terrestrial and space applications:
x One or more subjects lie on a rotating support or turntable with heads near the spin axis where radius ( r ) approaches 0.
x As the device spins, subjects experience approximately half of the resulting g-force at waists (50% gravity gradient) and the maximum at their feet.

x Long-arm centrifuges are useful for calibrating human tolerances to angular velocities along with influences upon neurovestibular sensory disturbances, but restraints upon subject movement and activities limit adaptation/ performance lessons.

Partial-gravity conditions experienced on lunar/planetary surface missions will be for more Earth-like than those associated with weightlessness or artificial-g.

x Astronauts will adopt quite easily, rapidly learning how to modify their locomotion and activities accordingly.
x Habitats will be designed with a familiar normal-g vertical orientation where "up" and "down" are constant, sleeping is always horizontal, and floors, ceilings and walls are traditional.

x While exercise will still be important to maintain good physical fitness, the deconditioning effects experienced in weightlessness may be less severe.
x Particulate matter in the internal habitat atmosphere which can present hygiene and health hazards will settle to the surface where it is more controllable.

x Toilet and hygiene equipment will function in a familiar, gravity-assisted fashion, and restraint systems will generally not be needed to hold people and loose items in place.

x There will be no Coriolis forces associated with A-g to detrimentally effect sensory and operational functions, and no gravity level transitions or gradients that impose special medical concerns or activity challenges.

Reduced gravity levels (0.16g Moon/0.38 g Mars) effect human locomotion by changing walking and running gaits, posture and traction:

Walking velocities partial-g are lower than on Earth:

x The speed at which walking changes to running is also slower, and the speed of running considerably slower than on Earth as well (6.04 m/sec under normal g vs. 3.99 m/sec on the Moon).

x According to 0.16g simulations, the most comfortable gait is "loping" at a speed of 3 m/sec, vs. 1.2 m/sec walking on Earth, an advantage afforded by reduced energy requirements for acceleration.

Locomotion on Lunar Gravity

PARTIAL-G CONSIDERATIONS

HUMAN INFLUENCES

D-5

Human posture during locomotion under partial-g conditions differs from posture during running on Earth:
x As speed is increased in lunar gravity, the angle of the forward body inclination becomes progressively larger. (The inclination of a sprinting gait on Earth is 10 degrees, while the loping gait on the Moon is 60 degrees.)
x Apollo Program experience indicates that a loping gate of about 3 m/sec is most comfortable with a forward body inclination of about 45 degrees.
PARTIAL-G CONSIDERATIONS

Body Posture in Reduced Gravity
HUMAN INFLUENCES

D-6

Reduced traction under partial-g conditions influences human balance and locomotion:
x Limited friction between a person and the ground surface makes it more difficult to rapidly change positions to avoid moving or falling objects or to gain a surer foothold or handhold under hazardous circumstances.
x While the same inertial force is required to start moving from a complete stop, the ability of a person (or vehicle) to overcome that inertial force is reduced because of impaired surface traction.
PARTIAL-G CONSIDERATIONS

Surface Traction
HUMAN INFLUENCES

D-7

People bounce higher when walking or running in reduced gravity, and although running within a space habitat would seem unlikely, some possible influences on ceiling heights might be considered:
x During normal walking in 0.16g (worst case between lunar and Martian applications), humans will probably bounce no higher than 2.44 m (standard Earth ceiling height) because their body inclination will be approximately 20 degrees.
x At a loping speed of 3 m/sec with a body inclination of 45 percent, a standard ceiling height would probably still be sufficient.

It should be no surprise that humans can jump higher under reduced gravity conditions:
x Tests have demonstrated that people can jump 3.7-4.3 m vertically in 0.16g when unencumbered by a spacesuit, while they can jump (rather than use stairs).
x Related tests show that the easiest way to access a landing height of 1.25m in 0.16g is simply to jump (rather that use stairs).
x Ladders are the most likely devices for vertical translation within small module habitats because they require very little space.

It is likely that stairs would be used for interior areas, but they might be useful to enable EVAsuited astronauts to gain access or egress from elevated modules. Stairs in lunar gravity should be designed with a riser height spacing between 41 cm and 1.25 m.

DESIGN INFLUENCES

D-9

In reduced gravity, a normal and comfortable sitting position will probably be different than on Earth:
x Earth gravity pulls the body into a nearly 90 degree normal and comfortable sitting position, and in microgravity the body assumes a `'neutral buoyancy `'posture. It is expected that reduced gravity will produce postures between these condition.
x It is theorized that seated body posture in 0.16g will be closer to the neutral buoyancy position, and could be accommodated by a system that supports the body only at the knees/thigh region.

Seated Posture and Support
DESIGN INFLUENCES

D-10

Reduced gravity conditions on the Moon and Mars will have important influences upon site planning, system engineering and operations:

Disadvantages:
x Mobility vehicles and equipment used to tow, push or dig/drill into the surface will be handicapped with regard to wheel traction or mass to counteract mechanical forces.
x Landing/launch sites must be located at considerable distances from vulnerable/ human facilities to minimize rocket thruster ejecta projectile hazards (reduced gravity and little or no atmosphere will extend ballistic ranges).

Advantages:
x As a benefit, people and equipment will be able to lift objects of much greater mass than they could on Earth, including structures, equipment and supplies.
x Enhanced abilities to lift will offer real advantages for crews who must transport/ relocate large equipment racks and, expendables and other elements without aid of cranes or other mechanisms.

SECTION E : PSYCHOLOGICAL & SOCIAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS FOR SPACE HABS

E-2

Prolonged space exploration missions with induce severe psychological and social stresses: x Isolation and confinement:
-Separation from loved ones, friends and community. -Lack of access to enjoyed places and activities. -Restricted volume, amenities and entertainment . -Interactions limited to a small group living and working in close quarters.
x Monotony and boredom: -Routine schedules dictated by mission requirements. -Altered day-night cycles without seasonal changes. -Tiresome tasks without access to "outside services". -Limited menu, clothing and environmental variety.
Stress Inducements

Psychological and social stresses can impair crew morale, performance and interpersonal relationships: x Influences upon the individual:
-Anxiety and depression leading to wide mood shifts. -Motivational impairments upon work performance. -Sleep patterns change causing fatigue and reduced alertness. -Antisocial actions that harm relationships and safety.
x Influences upon group behaviors: -Crew member and ground personnel conflicts. -Difficulties in working as a cooperative team . -Intolerances to small personality and action irritants. -Depression/paranoia impairing mission performance.
Stress Reactions

PSYCHO-SOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

GENERAL INFLUENCES

E-3

Influences effecting psychological and social stressors include:
x Personal space infringements associated with crowding and limited volume, comfort and privacy.
x Demanding activities and schedules (stimulus overload and deprivations).
x Lack of personal choices (inabilities to exercise control over decision and behavior options).
x Complexities/ difficulties of tasks (and limitations upon people/ tools for these tasks).
x Isolation from outside contacts (limited window views and communications with loved ones).
x Constrained variety (food menu, internal furnishings, clothing and other choices).
x Character of the sensory environment (aesthetics, lighting systems, colors and materials).
Environmental and Operational Influences

Mission success and safety depends upon the mental health and stability of each individual: x The uncontrollable actions of one person can
jeopardize the entire crew. x Unlike life on Earth, one cannot leave the problem
by getting out of the environment. x Fatigue and physiological deconditioning will
impair abilities to cope with frustrations over time. x Individuals must be prepared to "fill in" for others
who become ill or incapacitated. x Accidents, mechanical emergencies and other
unscheduled problems will demand teamwork. x Future mission crews may be more technically
trained, but have less "right stuff" spirit. x Small interpersonal disagreements can lead to
serious conflicts without opportunities to "cool off".

Various people react differently to the same surrounding conditions and stimuli:
x Some can adapt more readily to close living contact and crowding than others.
x Attitudes and expectations regarding privacy can be influenced by cultural backgrounds.
x Individuals respond differently to stress and abilities to work under pressure.
x Extroverted vs. introverted tendencies, humor and communication skills influence interpersonal relations.
x Aesthetic preferences and responses to particular foods, smells and music tend to be personal.
Personal Differences

Behavioral and mood changes often occur over the period of a long mission: x Crew morale is typically highest at the
beginning of the experience. x Individual and team spirit often bottoms out
after the middle of the stay. x Morale can be elevated by special events and
communications (mail drops/ supply ships). x Unscheduled emergencies, task schedule
slippages and interpersonal conflicts can cause depression. x Crew bonding is often most apparent near a missions end.

Good space mission planning must consider appropriate human-machine roles and relationships:

What humans do best:
x Pursue a diverse range of tasks, including many that require mobility and dexterity.
x Respond to unplanned opportunities and problems with innovative solutions.
x Recognize, interpret and respond appropriately to complex patterns of sound.
x Reason inductively to exercise judgment with limited and incomplete data.
x Store experiential information and recall relevant facts at appropriate times.

What machines do best:
x Respond rapidly to control signals and handle numerous complex tasks simultaneously.
x Perform routine/ exacting tasks reliably without fatigue.
x Store/ process large amounts of complex data using deductive methods.
x Apply great force smoothly and precisely with or without human control.
x Handle hazardous tasks under extreme environmental conditions.

Experiences on US and Russian spacecraft, polar stations and underwater vessels have revealed a variety of common issues:

x Cut off from "the outside", crews must learn to be resourceful, and to depend upon one another:
-They must work to help crewmates deal with mental and physical stresses.
-They are required to adapt to a lack of familiar comfort and recreational amenities.
-They must be prepared for fatiguing work overloads and stimuli deprivations.
-They must be prepared to address equipment malfunctions that can jeopardize activities and lives.

x Common types of constraints place severe requirements and restrictions on habitat design and operations:
-Limitations on internal volumes that can be delivered to support human activities.
-Limitations on equipment, labor and processes for structure assembly/deployment.
-Limitations on maintenance and repairs (people, tools/ spares and methods).
-Safety and operations under harsh environmental conditions and demanding mission schedules.

Confinement on submarines can also provide behavioral data that can be informative for planning prolonged space missions:
 A large quantity of psychological data has been collected since 1953 about human adaptation and performance under adverse and stressful conditions.
 Crew populations on modern US ballistic missile submarines are relatively large, typically about 140 officers and enlisted personnel, creating cramped living conditions.
 Crews however, are primarily young single men, who are likely to be more homogenous than future space voyagers.

Minimizing perceived and real safety risks is essential to crew morale and wellbeing:

 Limited spare parts, tools and repair specialty skills on long missions will demand high levels of system reliability.

 Crews must be cross-trained to undertake critical functions previously performed by an incapacitated or deceased team member.

 All maintenance and repair operations must be planned to be as simple as possible, using standardized parts and tools.

 Comprehensive instructions must be available to cover all contingencies in event of lost communication with ground support.

Cosmonaut Selection Considerations: Since the beginning of their space program, the Russians have applied rigorous psychological testing and training prior to flight. Important cosmonaut selection criteria include:
x A low general anxiety level. x An emotionally well-balanced outlook. x An extrovert personality. x High-level intellectual/ perceptive abilities. x Steady voluntary attention spans. x Good attention separability/ changeability. x Good memory for details. x A capability to control personal reactions.

Crew Organization and Schedules:
x Size and composition: Small crews often have high levels of interdependency. The mix of skills, cultural/ professional backgrounds and personalities is important.
x Sex and role identity: Crews must avoid stereotypic views and behavior. They must be versatile to adapt to changing circumstances and needs as required.
x Leadership and motivation: Teams can be organized around democratic or authoritarian models. Mutual respect and confidence must be common to both.
x Activity schedules: All experience demonstrates that good crew morale and performance requires a proper balance between work and leisure.

"Habitability" generally refers to environments and accommodations that can be incorporated into space habitats to optimize crew safety, health satisfaction and performance:
x To have a positive influence upon how effectively and safely people can accomplish mission tasks.
x To provide medical and exercise facilities to monitor and maintain physiological conditions throughout the missions.
x To create interior areas that are comfortable, convenient and attractive.
x To design environments, facilities and equipment to emphasize ease of understanding, use and maintenance.

Humans in space have the same basic needs that apply on Earth, but their isolated, crowded and constrained living and work conditions add special challenges :
x Variety and versatility in the design and use of habitats is essential to mitigate feelings of isolation and boredom.
x Facilities and schedules should accommodate exercise, recreation and social activities necessary for health and morale.
x Private places are needed for reading, listening to music and other leisure activities.
x Means to maintain hygienic conditions are vital, since closed space habitats are vulnerable to rapid microbial growth.

-Shuttle crews use a squirt gun to wet a wash cloth to soap up, and a second wash cloth to rinse off. Towels, wash cloths and other items can attach to walls with Velcro.
x Shaving:
-Dry shaving with electric razors cause whiskers to float around and produce eye/ lung irritation and equipment damage, so wind-up shavers with vacuum attachments work better.
-Depilatory creams or gels can be used, and shaving cream with safety razors seem to work best. (Some astronauts prefer to avoid shaving and grow beards.)

x Operational functions differ from conditions on Earth: -Fecal eliminations are more problematic without gravity to assist the process. -Neutral buoyancy body posture and tendencies to float impose restraint requirements. -Urinal- body interface devices must be provided and adapted to gender differences.
x Contamination prevention safeguards are of vital importance: -Spilled waste fluids and solids can escape and spread into surrounding areas. -Fecal products and other unsanitary materials must be safely contained/ treated. -Compartment surfaces and devices must be designed for easy wipe-downs.

While future long-duration exploration missions may need to recycle human wastes, current systems used for weightless conditions on the Shuttle Orbiter and ISS do not: x Waste Collection:
-Urine collection interfaces must accommodate for anatomical gender differences. (While collection from men can be easily accomplished using tubes, women have experienced annoying difficulties.) -Toeholds, handholds and thigh or waste restraints are needed to hold the occupant firmly in place to assure a good seal with the commode seat. x Waste Treatment: -Commodes must have separate receptacles for feces and urine. (Without gravity, high speed air streams carry solid and liquid waste into respective receptacles.) -Solid waste is vacuum dried, chemically treated with germicides to prevent odor and bacteria growth, and stored for return to Earth. Liquid is stored and dumped overboard.

Personal sleeping quarters can offer private places where individuals can pursue leisure activities:
x Privacy is important to enable crew member to "escape" and enjoy quiet pastimes such as:
-Reading, watching videos and listening to music.
-Undertaking work/ study tasks, compiling notes and communicating using laptops and audio recording devices.
x Weightless conditions present unique design considerations:
-Compartments can be oriented in any direction since "up" and "down" are terms that are relative to the local vertical that is established.
-Astronauts will float around the compartments unless secured (e.g., sleeping bags).
-Stowed clothing and other items must be secured/ contained in place (e.g., using soft stowage systems with pockets).
-Active ventilation is needed to prevent exhaled carbon dioxide from collecting around a sleeping person's face causing oxygen deprivation.

Under weightless conditions, astronauts need not lie "down" to sleep, and some have slept while simply floating around the spacecraft:
x Sleep Styles:
-After sleeping for a short time, some astronauts have tried to roll over, and woke themselves up flailing their arms and legs.
-Some awoke feeling dizzy from their weightless heads bobbing around, and preferred to use forehead straps to avoid this sensation.
-Some people like waist straps that press their bodies against the support to have the sensation of lying on a mattress.
x Sleep Conditions:
-In a 200 mile orbit, the sun rises and sets every 1 ½ hours, so there is no long dark night. Eye shades and ear muffs can reduce disturbing light and noise for those who want to use them.
-If an entire crew sleeps at the same time, at least 2 must wear communications headphones in case an emergency arises or ground controllers call.

The Sun is a medium-sized star composed primarily of hydrogen:
x The Sun is located 152 million km from Earth: -It contains one million times Earth's volume. -Its diameter is 110 times larger than Earth's.
x Nuclear fusion of hydrogen at enormous pressure produces helium at 300 million degrees: -Hydrogen fusion causes emission of charged particles, radiation, meteoroids, cosmic rays and electromagnetic waves. -The Sun is responsible for Earth's weather, but only 2 billionth of the sun's total energy reaches our planet.
x Solar proton storms extend far beyond Earth, presenting radiation hazards to exposed astronauts and spacecraft equipment: -The Earth's magnetosphere and atmosphere provide substantial shielding on the surface. -Operations in LEO receive benefits from Earth's magnetosphere to reduce hazards. -The Van Allen Belts that surround Earth trap radiation, creating a very hazardous zone.

The Sun's structure is comprised of a core, a photosphere, a chromosphere and a corona: x The core is the innermost 10 percent of the Sun's mass
where energy from nuclear fusion is generated: -The core temperature reaches 16 million K, and the density is 160 g/ cm3. -Energy is transported outward by radiation in the convective envelope zone. x Rising and falling gas transfers energy to the photosphere (the Sun's visible surface): -Dark sunspots from which rope-like magnetic fields rise and descend are known as "coronal holes". -The chromosphere is a thin layer above the photosphere and is hotter than the photosphere (the temperature increases outward into the corona). -Fast-moving ions from the corona escape the sun to form solar winds.

Sunspots are "cool" region's which form in the photosphere (7,600qF) that accompany other surface events which fluctuate in frequency over 11 year cycles:
x At "solar maximum" more bright clouds of gas called "prominences" form above sunspots, as well as powerful solar flare eruptions:
-Smaller "quiet prominences" form either in the corona about 40,000 km above the surface or in loops of hydrogen that follow magnetic field loops.
-"Surge" prominences lasting up to a few hours shoot gas up to 300,000 km.
-Solar flare electrons and protons move with enough energy to escape the Sun's gravity and reach beyond Earth.
-Solar flares can interfere with radio communications on Earth and in space, and present radiation hazards to expeditions beyond LEO.

BACKGROUND

G-5

Solar energetic particles (including electrons and protons) comprise the "solar wind" that stream past Earth at speeds up to one million miles per hour:
x The particles are redistributed and accelerated by the Earth's magnetic field in a region called the magnetosphere: -Redistribution of solar energy results in channeling large amounts of energy, equivalent up to 100 million kilowatts of energy each day to the Earths atmosphere in polar regions. -Energetic particles collide with elements of the upper atmosphere at altitudes between 90-150 kilometers, producing the emission of light (an aurora).
SPACE RADIATION

The Earth's magnetosphere provides protection from energetic particles.
Solar Wind
BACKGROUND

Solar radiation is a dominant source in the vicinity of Earth: x Large solar flares can produce dangerous Solar
Particle Events (SPEs): -SPEs can produce lethal radiation intensities for unprotected astronauts. -Polar orbits inside Earth's magnetosphere are exposed to elevated levels because the magnetic field dips down at the poles. x Radiation trapped by Earth's geomagnetic field in Van Allen Belts is particularly hazardous: -Protons comprise the primary source within the inner zone. -The most intense inner zone is the "South Atlantic Anomaly", a region between Africa and South America where orbits of spiraling protons reach closest to Earth. -The outer belt, primarily comprised of electrons, has a total intensity about an order of magnitude higher than the inner zone.

Space regions beyond the Van Allen Belts are dominated by Galactic Cosmic Radiation (GCR):
x These particles are created by cataclysmic events such as supernova explosions outside the Solar System: -Particle energies are typically very high, measured up to 1020 electron volts (eV). -GCRs consist primarily of protons, with smaller contributions of helium and heavier ions such as iron. -Although GCRs have very low flux densities, their extremely high energy levels enable them to penetrate virtually any passive shield of reasonable mass. -In the unlikely event that shielding is capable of stopping primary radiation particles, secondary particles such as neutrons, peons and recoil nuclei would still be emitted, limiting health benefits to a crew.

G-9

An atom is ionized when one or more electrons is stripped away, such as from a collision with a speeding proton:
x Injury to a living organism occurs when high energy protons, cosmic rays, x-rays or gamma rays penetrate and split apart cell molecules, damaging or killing them: -Particles passing through an obstruction such as spacecraft walls, create another hazard called secondary radiation. -Heavy cosmic ray particles such as nuclei of carbon, oxygen and iron atoms do the most damage because they carry greater positive electrical charges than protons, causing more ionization within the cells. -Protons, however, do the most overall damage because there are so many of them since they comprise the primary substance of most cosmic rays.
SPACE RADIATION

The degree of damage to organisms from various ionizing radiation types is estimated according to assigned value standards:
x Particle Energy (MeV/ GeV): -Cosmic rays have energy levels extending to 1020 ev, but mainly between 100s MeV to 20 GeV. -Trapped electrons in the Van Allen Belts range in energy between several hundred MeV. -SPEs lasting from a few hours to several days can produce energies up to several GeV.
x Charge (Z): -High-Z and high energy particles associated with GCR are of particular concern in planning exploratory missions beyond the magnetosphere.
x Quality (Q): -This is a value set by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) as a factor that, when multiplied by dose, projects biological cell damage.

The extent to which ionizing radiation causes biological damage is influenced by the amount of energy absorbed (dose) and the radiation type:
x Dose is expressed in rad or Gray are determined by multiplying dose (expressed in rad or Gray). -Relative biological effectiveness of different radiations is determined by multiplying dose times quality factor Q to determine a doseequivalent (expressed in terms of rem or sievert (Sv)). -One Sv equals 100 rem . (1mSv= .0001 Sv=1 rem).
x NASA limits the amount of radiation received deep in "Blood Forming Organs" (BFO's) to maximum levels: -Career limits depend upon an individual's gender and age at beginning of exposure.

HEALTH RISK ASSESSMENTS

G-12

Radiation risk assessments consider special vulnerability factors:

x Some parts of the human body are more vulnerable to radiation damage than others:
-The skin and eyes are most accessible to a wide range of energy particles with limited penetration characteristics, yet are less susceptible to injury than many other parts of the body.
-Certain deeper locations (bone marrow, lungs, pancreas and liver) are of special concern due to susceptibility to cancers.
-Possibilities exist where doses to eyes and skin can be very high without BFO limits being approached (such as during EVAs in trapped electron belts), the reason ancillary eye and skin standards have been set.

x Individuals present different risks:
-Women face added risks of breast cancers and damage of reproductive processes which can induce early menopause, birth defects in future children and miscarriages as delayed effects.
-People with different backgrounds (geographic, occupational and age-related) have received varying radiation exposures that contribute to allowable career doses.
-A 30-40 year old beginning astronaut will have a career limit between 200-275 rem, and a 50 rem annual limit will ensure that the career dose will be spread out over a protracted period.

Radiation presents a primary health risk for space exploration:
x Overt human reactions to radiation exposure can be immediate or delayed: -Near-term manifestations can include nausea, vomiting, decreased white blood cells, diarrhea, fever, hemorrhage and death. -Delayed effects include cancer, birth defects in progeny, and miscarriages.
x Some people are more prone to develop cancers than others: -Future astronaut selection for long-duration exploration missions may have to give family histories careful consideration. -Selection of older candidates with low previous cumulative lifetime doses could also reduce risks of premature deaths due to cancers.

GCRs which present consistent low level background radiation on Earth are highly problematic in deeper space:
x Levels are inversely proportional to the Sun's storm actively due to the changing magnetic field on the Sun: -GCR is made up of atomic nuclei of densities ranging from helium (low) to iron (high) with extremely high energy levels. -As GCRs pass through tissue, they scatter atomic particles (electrons, protons, gamma rays, etc.) with each collision and produce very harmful secondaries.
x While the rem and rad have often been used to signify radiation effects, more recently standard international units are often used; the Gray (Gy) and the Seivert: -Radiation Dose: 1 Gy= 100 rad= 1000 mGy= 1 J/ kg -Biological Equivalent Dose: 1 Sv= 100 rem= 1000 mSv= Gy x Q

HEALTH RISK ASSESSMENTS

G-16

For Earth-orbiting spacecraft, the altitude of the vehicle and inclination of the orbit are important dose rate determinants: x Spacecraft Altitude:
-LEO spacecraft receive substantial shielding from the Earth's magnetic field. -Geomagnetic shielding benefits decrease with higher altitude, disappearing at about 6 Earth radii (geosynchronous orbit). x Orbit Inclination: -A 28.5 degree inclination orbit will carry the spacecraft through the South Atlantic Anomaly, adding about 0.1 rem/ day over Earth levels (equivalent to about 10 chest x-rays/ day). -The Russian Mir space stations 52 degree orbit passed through the South Atlantic Anomaly more rapidly, producing lower radiation dose exposures.
SPACE RADIATION

Attitude & Inclination Influences
MISSION CONSIDERATIONS

G-17

Alpha particles do more damage in humans than x-rays because they have a higher Q factor. For low-inclination orbits (35 degrees or lower) the Q factor is approximately 1, so that a rem is about equal to a rad.
x Doses on Shuttle flights have ranged from 0.05-0.65 rem (well below flight crew exposure limits of 75 rads/ year-whole body, and 400 rad career limit.
x Skylab's longest 85 day mission resulted in less than 8 rems (whole body) and 17.85 rems (skin).
x The highest radiation exposure in space was 160 rems received during cosmonaut Sergi Avdeyev's 784 day stay on the Mir space station.

MISSION CONSIDERATIONS

G-18

Radiation hazard limitations and risks will increase as mission frequencies and lengths increase:

x There may never be "career" astronauts in the context of long-term, continuous professional livelihoods.

x Risks of exposures to major Solar Particle Events will become more likely during extended missions in LEO and beyond:

-A 30 year-old male on his first 180 day LEO mission could look forward to a maximum of 5 more similar duty tours before exceeding the 200 rem career limit set for his age group and gender.
-A 50 year-old male might spend up to a total of 5 years in space before reaching his 350 rem limit.

-Routine missions extending throughout the Sun's 11 year cycle of activity will create a high SPE exposure probability for some crews.
-A very large SPE in August, 1972 would have produced about 135 rem to BFO inside a module with 2.0 g/ cm2 (0.75 cm Al) shielding, potentially creating serious but non-lethal illnesses. (Acceptable 14 rem levels would require 20 g/ cm2/ 7.5 cm Al shielding.)

SPACE RADIATION

Flight Frequency & Length
MISSION CONSIDERATIONS

SPE occurrences correlate with sunspot activity: x Extremely large flares are relatively rare, occurring only a
few days per decade. x Accurate predictions of occurrences or intensities are
currently impossible. x Although SPE particles are less penetrating than GCRs
due to lower energies, their high flux density can make them very dangerous.

G-19

SPACE RADIATION

Solar Energetic Particle Events
MISSION CONSIDERATIONS

G-20

Better understanding about space radiation dangers and countermeasures is needed to prepare for missions beyond LEO including lunar/ Mars destinations:
x While general dose rates will be comparable to levels Apollo astronauts received, flight durations will be much longer: -Missions to Mars and back may require 3 years or more, demanding that we more fully understand the nature of space radiation, its effects upon health, and effective ways to mitigate the dangers.
x We presently lack a sound basis for developing reliable quality factors for GCR, and there is disagreement among researchers about appropriate dosage limits or how to translate the number/ intensity of encounters to rem. -Given rudimentary scientific knowledge of SPE causes, early warning systems are not presently available.
SPACE RADIATION

Voyages Beyond LEO
MISSION CONSIDERATIONS

G-21

There are three basic ways to minimize space radiation health risks in space:

1. Operationally Minimize Crew Exposures:
x Operate LEO spacecraft at lowest possible altitudes to benefit from Earths geomagnetic shield.
x Limit mission lengths and the number of astronaut duty tours.
x Use fastest practical transport vehicles and transfer trajectories.
x Restrict EVAs, using telerobotic and automated systems to the extent possible.
x Schedule missions beyond LEO to periods of lowest solar activity.

2. Carefully Screen Crew Candidates:
x Select people who are lowest cancer risks based upon family backgrounds and general health.
x Use older crews with low lifetime doses.
3. Provide Shielding and Storm Shelters:
x Supplement aluminum spacecraft pressure shells with additional shielding layers.
x Provide water bladders around crew areas/ radiation storm shelters using logistic water.
x Cover lunar/ Mars habitats with surface materials.

SPACE RADIATION

Risk Mitigation Approaches
POSSIBLE COUNTERMEASURES

G-22

Spacecraft cabin walls provide some shielding in LEO, but will not offer much protection in higher orbits:
x Secondary Radiation: -Radiation produced when a primary cosmic ray strikes and ionizes a metal spacecraft material (typically aluminum) will readily penetrate the cabin and scatter numerous times, multiplying the destructive potential. -Ionizing effects of electrons that populate the outer radiation belt and beyond are of great concern, contributing to radiation levels in geosynchronous orbit (GEO) which are about 3 orders of magnitude worse than LEO.
x Aluminum Shielding: -Aluminum is commonly used for spacecraft construction due to light weight and moderate cost. -Capabilities of the material to provide GCR and SPE protection outside the Earth's magnetosphere will be severely limited by shell thickness vs. launch mass constraints.
SPACE RADIATION

Reducing the nominal daily BFO dose equivalent from 170 mrem by approximately half in a 500 km x 28.5q orbit will increase an aluminum shell thickness about 9 times.
Aluminum Shielding Limitations
POSSIBLE COUNTERMEASURES

G-23

Protection from large SPEs might be accomplished by adding mass (t 20g/cm2) to or within the walls of a habitat or special storm shelter refuge area :
x Using additional thickness or layers of aluminum, plastics or other solid materials will present launch mass problems (a half-sphere aluminum shelter of 2 meter diameter will exceed 1.3 metric tons).
x Bladders of stored water used for logistics may offer a reasonable alternative, since a substantial amount will be required to support mission operations and would impose little or no extra launch mass.
x Ionized water has a short radiation half-life and could be safely consumed for drinking within hours or days following a SPE.

SPACE RADIATION

POSSIBLE COUNTERMEASURES

G-24

A variety of lunar habitat shielding concepts have been proposed to take advantage of natural geologic features and surface materials for radiation protection:
x Putting modules in underground lava tubes.
x Tunneling into crater walls.
x Covering facilities with 50 centimeters or more of lunar soil (regolith).

Each of these proposed approaches present significant problems:
x Use of lava tubes will severely limit site selection and development options.
x Tunneling or material transfer to cover modules will require large, automated equipment, and it will be difficult or impossible to connect other modules later.

SECTION H: EVA EQUIPMENT & OPERATIONS

H-2

EVA space suits designed for LEO and lunar/ Mars conditions must respond to special environmental operating influences:

x Gravity levels determine carry weight, body posture, translation movements and work leverage:

x Micrometeoroids represent a special hazard for LEO EVA crews:

- Carry weight includes the suit, backpack, tools, and objects being manipulated.

- Space suits with an outer protective layer can afford some protection.

- Body posture in weightlessness is neutral ­g, becoming more normalized with partial-gravity.

x Dust presents particular problems on the Moon and Mars:

- Translation movement in weightlessness is primarily hand-over-hand using hands and firearms, vs. "bounding" on the Moon/ Mars using legs.
x Radiation levels are most severe beyond LEO:
- Except for passes through the South Atlantic Anomoly, greatest LEO risks are from SPEs.
- The Moon is protected only by hemispheric mass of the planet during night, while the thin Mars atmosphere affords some additional protection.

- It can abrade suit coverings, scratch helmet visors, cover external displays, degrade outer garment absorptivity and emissivity, and contaminate seals and bearings.
- On Apollo 17, dust made it difficult for astronaut Jack Schmitt to secure his suit gloves, and wore through the outer layer after only 3 EVAs.
- Electrostatic and mechanical dust properties cause it to cling to suits.

x Lighting control is essential during EVAs:
- In LEO, suits have protective visors and lights to enable crews to work in alternating sunlight/ shadow.
- The lack of an atmosphere in LEO and on the Moon, and the thin atmosphere on Mars, prevent/ minimize filtering of light that occurs on Earth, causing very high illumination levels and harsh shadows.
- Sun angles on the Moon can cause "whiteout" conditions, so that EVA operations are best scheduled when shadows add visual dimensions.
- Since the Earth's brightness is 60 times that of the Moon, reflected Earth light enables near-side EVAs during lunar night.
- The diurnal cycle on Mars is similar to Earth's, presenting similar lighting conditions.

H-5

Space suits have systems ranging from minimum physiological limits at 25.9 kPa, to the limits of glove performance at 57.2 kPa:
x For pure oxygen, the maximum pressure to avoid toxicity is 41.3 kPa for continuous exposure, and 68.9 kPa for up to 18 hours of exposure every 120 hours.
x Transitioning from a higher pressure habitat with mixed gases to lower pressure suits using pure oxygen requires a period of prebreathe to purge nitrogen from the blood.
x Prebreathe time ensures safety, but adds significantly to EVA schedules.
x Going from a 2-gas atmosphere to a single gas atmosphere requires purge time, also adding to schedules.
x Current planning requires about 4 hours to go from the ISS at 101.3 kPa to the US's EVA Mobility Unit (EMU) at 29.6 kPa. (This eliminates rapid EVAs or using a suit for emergency backup if pressure fails.)

Making pressures more similar for habitats and suits reduces prebreathe time:

x If 24 hours before an EVA, the Shuttle's cabin pressure is lowered from 101.3 kPa to 70.3 kPa, prebreathe time is reduced to 1 hour during cabin pressure reduction, followed by 40 minutes of additional prebreathing prior to the EVA.
x The Russian protocol requires 30 minutes to transition from 101.3 kPa to 40 kPa.

Selecting space suit pressure involves a trade off between reduced risk of bends and greater glove mobility:
x Relationships between habitat and suit pressures:
- Bends (decompression sickness) occurs when nitrogen in the blood stream passes into surrounding tissue and expands as atmospheric pressure decreases.
- This is significant for EVAs because space suits typically operate at lower pressures than the spacecraft.

x The effort required to close one's hand in a glove under pressure is fatiguing during long EVA sessions involving a great deal of hand work:
- Final pressure suit selection must consider adequate glove mobility as well as cabin pressure and minimum suit pressure to eliminate bends risk.
- Suit pressures equal to about 60 percent of cabin pressure is usually considered safe from aeroembolism (bends).
x Atmosphere selection must also consider other hazards:
- Oxygen enrichment in cabin air increases fire hazards.
- Above 30 percent oxygen, flammability risks severely limit materials that can be used in a habitat.

SUIT DESIGN CRITERIA

H-8

Space suit selection and design is influenced by operational conditions in different environments and the nature of workload activities to be performed:

x Operating in a pressure suit requires a great deal of effort:
- The suit's mass and torque required to move joints impose high workloads.
- Maintaining stability and responding to transverse forces on the Moon/ Mars requires special concentration due to suit mass influences that change the center of gravity.
- Visibility is constrained by the helmet and visor, presenting special mobility and operational challenges (such as falling or bumping into obstacles).
x High workloads can produce rapid body fluid losses:
- As much as 3 kg of body weight can be perspired away during a few hours of EVA.
- Liquid-cooled garments can control body temperature to decrease perspiration, and drink bag dispensers in helmets can replenish lost fluids.
- Metabolic rates determine temperature control requirements.

x Under high workloads, astronauts use more oxygen and produce more CO2:
- Due to the small atmospheric volume, high percentages of CO2 can rapidly build up in suits.
- Even relatively low percentages of CO2 can cause physiological reactions such as increased heart and perspiration rates, mental depression, headaches, and dizziness/ nausea.
- High CO2 concentrations produce mental stupor, unconsciousness and death.
- Life support systems remove CO2, and ventilation systems prevent buildup.
- Production of CO2 depends upon metabolic rate and perspiration quotient (the ratio of O2 intake and CO2 production).
- High-carbohydrate diets yield higher CO2 production than high-fat diets.

Suit Life Support Requirements

EVA EQUIPMENT/OPERATIONS

SUIT DESIGN CRITERIA

H-9

Space suits present special limitations, constraints and requirements associated with radiation safety, orientation adaptation and visibility:

x EVA suits offer little protection against space radiation:
- SPEs pose the biggest and potentially a lethal threat, and can happen at any time.
- Outside the protection of LEO, the only effective response is a retreat to a sheltered enclosure.
- EVA crews on the Moon will have only about a 30 minute warning. (Assuming an average walk-back rate of 2 km/ hour, or a rover ride at 8 km/ hour, they should only explore 1-4 km from a storm shelter.)
x EVA presents a special case for space orientation:
- To help Shuttle crews adapt to weightlessness, no EVAs are scheduled for the first 72 hours following launch. (This is partly to prevent possibilities of vomiting in the suit.)
- EVA in orbit lacks visual up/ down orientation references except for foot restraints (while orientation on the Moon/ Mars is aligned with the gravity vector and horizon reference).

x Since EVA crews must be able to see to work and survive, good suit visibility is essential:
- Hand-over-hand translation used in weightlessness requires overhead visibility (similar to climbing a ladder).
- The Russians have incorporated overhead viewing features into their Orlan M space suit for ISS.
- Planetary EVA suits should provide downward visibility for walking and locating/ reaching surface objects.
- Helmet visors are necessary to reduce glare and avoid direct sunlight.
- Ventilation and low humidity is essential to prevent helmet fogging.
- Replaceable visors are important to eliminate scratches and dust buildups that interfere with viewing.
- Displays should be designed or covered to avoid dust films and reflections that obscure effective use.

Suit Limitations & Priorities

EVA EQUIPMENT/OPERATIONS

SUIT DESIGN CRITERIA

H-10

Suit hygiene is important to protect users from illness and discomfort:
x Perspiration during EVAs can be a source of microbial contamination:
- US crews must dry and wipe suits with a biocide material following use, requiring good access for inspecting and cleaning interior parts.
- Russian suits are an expendable space-based system along with consumables supplied from Earth.
- The Shuttle's EVA Mobility Unit (EMU) is a reusable ground-based system that draws upon consumables supplied by the Shuttle/ ISS.
x Since total pressurized suit time can be up to 8 hours, mitigating techniques and special garments are necessary for handling urine and feces:
- A low residual diet is applied to reduce waste products. - Crew members wear a urine collection device (male) or
disposable trunk to absorb and contain waste as an extra precaution.
EVA EQUIPMENT/OPERATIONS

Human factors for EVA must consider ways to size suits for different individuals and conditions:
x EVA effectiveness and comfort is directly influenced by suit fit:
- Russians use one size to fit cosmonauts of a particular size range.
- The Shuttle suit is modular and reusable, intended to adapt from 95th percentile US males, to 5th percentile US females.
- Future ISS or lunar/ Mars suits must be designed to consider means to adjust sizes for changeouts among crews using modular or adaptable elements.
x Proper fit must match changes in physical measurements that occur in space:
- In weightlessness, the spinal column extends about 3 percent, requiring that suits sized for Earth training must be changed.
- Similar changes may also occur on the Moon due to reduced gravity conditions.
Hygiene and Human Factors
SUIT DESIGN CRITERIA

H-11

Space suits adapt to biomechanical requirements imposed by different EVA environments and tasks:

x Mobility and flexibility:
- Different gravity levels influence locomotion methods (hand-over-hand in weightlessness and bounding gaits on the Moon).
- Fixed foot restraints used in weightlessness require that suits incorporate a rotational waist bearing to provide maximum reach flexibility.
- Astronauts on the Moon and Mars may sometimes need to right themselves back on their feet if they happen to fall, requiring flexibility in knees and elbows to accomplish this.
- Lunar/ Mars astronauts will need to be able to pick up and carry massive objects, requiring bending of legs, arms and shoulders.

x Dexterity and tactility requirements:
- Glove dexterity must allow free wrist movement and grasping, and tactility requires the ability to feel shapes through the glove material.
- Layers of material that provide pressure restraint and thermal insulation work against these capabilities.
- The most desirable features of gloves are snug fit without pressure points or discomfort, and low torque finger, thumb and wrist joints to minimize hand fatigue.
- Enhanced glove performance is the greatest benefit of lower pressure suits.

Biomechanical Features

EVA EQUIPMENT/OPERATIONS

SUIT DESIGN CRITERIA

H-12

Space suit design can mitigate fatigue and enhance EVA length and productivity:

x For EVA, fatigue critically affects comfort and safety:
- On the Moon and Mars, crewmembers will use legs and arms to carry the weight of the portable life support system, part of their suit and other items.
- In weightlessness, they will depend upon their hands to control movements of mass.
- Under all conditions, joint torque contributes greatly to fatigue, and the common and limiting source of fatigue is glove pressure.
- Repeatedly grasping a gloved hand is very tiring and painful, so it is desirable to design tasks around other suit joints such as the shoulders

x During typical 6 hour EVAs, suit comfort is an enabling requirement rather than a luxury:
- Suits must not only fit well, but must be comfortable in terms of temperature, humidity, air flow rate and noise control.
- Ease of donning and doffing suits is also important, since it can be an exhausting procedure. (Shuttle suits can go on and off in less than 10 minutes, and rear-entry Russian Orlan DMA or NASA's MKIII take even less time.)
- Soft suits allow for some give without producing irritation or bruises at contact points, and also avoid limits to joint flexure associated with many hard suit designs.

Fatigue & Comfort Factors

EVA EQUIPMENT/OPERATIONS

SUIT DESIGN CRITERIA

H-13

EVA planning must optimize information management and display:
x Exploration missions will present new requirements:
- While Shuttle EVAs are usually well defined and rehearsed many times before a mission, operations on the Moon and Mars will require a more open plan that supports quick decisions.
- Communication delays from Earth to Mars will make real-time ground instructions and responses impossible, requiring that suits be equipped with on-board navigation, lookup references, procedures and systems status monitors.
- Helmet noise must be controlled to reserve sound for voice communications and acoustic alarms.
- To support informed decisions, the crew must be able to access reference material immediately, often using internal visual displays.

Careful planning and preparations are essential to ensure that EVA procedures respond effectively to routine and anomalous requirements:

EVA operations are classified as scheduled, unscheduled or contingency:
- Scheduled operations are carefully planned and trained for in advance, including special mission tasks and routine spacecraft inspections and maintenance activities.
- Unscheduled events requiring EVAs can include verifying satisfactory functioning of an external mechanism and repairing or replacing a failed part.
- Contingency operations involve responses to emergency events which may be time, mission and life safety-critical.

EVAs generally consist of phased activities:
- Procedures are reviewed and systems are checked out.
- Prebreathe is accomplished for transitioning to the EVA environment.
- Tools and work aids are gathered for designed tasks.
- Readaptation to the spacecraft atmosphere occurs at the EVA conclusion.
- Suits are then be inspected for damage, wiped to remove perspiration and dust contamination, and replenished with consumables.

H-15

Mission requirements dictate EVA frequency, number of suits required, and support items that must be inventoried and stowed:

x EVA accommodations:

x Tools and work aids:

- Each Shuttle mission supports up to 8 scheduled and contingency EVAs, and pressure suits are worn during ascent reentry.

- For Apollo missions, tools to support lunar sample return included geologist's hammers, rakes, scoops and core drills.

- ISS operations call for up to 25 EVAs per EMU (before returning the EMU to Earth for ground maintenance).
- Russian suits don't return to Earth, and can support 10 EVAs (or up to 20 EVAs with on-orbit replacement of suit soft goods).
- EVAs use a buddy system (2 or more crew members) which affects the size of airlocks and amounts of consumables (water, oxygen and CO2 scrubbers), and surface rover accommodations.

- Shuttle EVA tools include special items for contingency closing of payload bay doors, and modified commercial hand tools for payload assembly.
- Shuttle and ISS work aids include safety tethers, portable foot restraints, helmet-mounted lights, and a "mini work station" on the front of the EMU.
- ISS EVAs are also supported by various US and International partner-supplied remote manipulator systems.

The beginnings of space suit technology began in the 1930s with Wiley Post's high altitude suit for aircraft:
x Humans need artificial pressurization above about 12 km (40,000 feet).
x Emergency high-altitude suits were developed in response to post-World War II military interests.
x By the mid-1950s, the US Air Force had developed a partial-pressure suit adequate to keep an airman alive in a high-altitude emergency until the aircraft could be brought to a lower altitude.
x By 1959, the Navy had developed a full pressure suit that was the technical precursor to the space suit used on Mercury flights.

The Gemini suit offered improved arm and leg mobility and was the first American suit actually used for EVA:
x Astronaut Ed White wore the suit for a 20minute "spacewalk" on Gemini 4:
- It did not have a portable life support system, and was connected to the spacecraft by an umbilical that provided oxygen.
- The suit operated at about 24 kPa (3.5 psi), and heat was removed by sweat evaporation from the skin.
- Sweat evaporation did not work well because the oxygen purge was uneven and the visor fogged up during hard work.

The Apollo suit had to be fully functional to permit locomotion by walking on the lunar surface: x The suit had a portable life support system
capable of supporting EVA for about 8 hours with some margin: - A liquid-cooled inner garment covering the entire body except for head and extremities was in contact with the skin for heat removal. - The garment was comprised of a nearly contiguous network of small tubing through which the liquid flowed, and provided adjustable temperature control. - The suit operated at 24 kPa of pure oxygen, and CO2 was removed by lithium hydroxide (LiOH) canisters. - Heat was rejected by water evaporation at about 0.5 kg/ hour at typical EVA metabolic rates.

x EVA was used extensively for planned mission activities as well as unscheduled ones:
- The EVA capability saved the Skylab Program, beginning with a critical solar wing repair and sunshade installation conducted during the first crew visit.
- Skylab missions had more unplanned than planned EVA hours.

The Shuttle Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) is similar to the space suit used for Apollo, but provides improved mobility and a new portable life support system:
x Unlike earlier suits which were individually tailored to each astronaut, the Shuttle suit is modular:
- Various parts such as arm and leg sections come in different sizes that can be selected to fit specific users.
- The EMU has a hard upper torso that is elliptic rather than cylindrical in cross section to provide a more useful work area for the crewperson's hands in front of the chest.
- The Shuttle EMU operates at a slightly higher pressure than its predecessors, 28 kPa (4.1 psi) because the Shuttle cabin operates at a much higher pressure, 100 kPa (14.7 psi).

Large differences between cabin and suit pressures present serious operational problems including long prebreathe times, causing Orbiter pressures to gradually be reduced to about 65 kPa (8 psi) prior to EVAs. Experimental hard suits have been developed to operate at this pressure for possible future applications:
x Joint design principles for hard suits have not been applied to gloves:
- The small parts size presents design and use difficulties, and volume compensation has proven problematic.
- Final selection of a higher new suit pressure will require glove design improvements to prevent hand fatigue during extended periods of use.

Suit pressures significantly above 25 kPa permit 2-gas atmospheres. Hard suit leakage is expected to be low enough that only oxygen will need to be replenished since the initial nitrogen charge will be adequate. Hard suit technology may also increase suit life to dozens or possibly hundreds of users.

Spacesuits must be constructed to contain pressure, resist penetrations, operate in a pure oxygen atmosphere, optimize mobility, minimize weight, provide desirable thermal properties, extend design life, afford inspectability and repair, and be comfortable:

x Soft suits use layered fabric materials that are selected to meet a variety of requirements:

x Hard suits and parts of soft suits combine different materials and elements:

- A urethane-coated nylon bladder inner layer contains pressure, and a woven Dacron fabric restrains it against ballooning and provides shape control at joints for mobility.
- Middle layers of insulation protect against radiant heat transfer.
- An outer layer "orthofabric" is made of a blend of Teflon, Kevlar and Nomex fabrics that resist puncture, abrasion and tearing, and is white to reflect sunlight.
- EVA suits for the Moon and Mars must control dust and maintain necessary thermal properties using tightly woven materials with a smooth finish, or a separate disposable outer garment cover.

- Upper torso sections can be formed from cast aluminum and fiberglass.
- Bearings and connectors are typically made from machined stainless steel or aluminum. (These components must resist damage from abrasion, particularly in a dusty environment such as on the Moon or Mars.)
- A key motivation in creating an all-aluminum AX-5 suit developed by NASA's Ames Research Center is to achieve precision and repeatability using machine production rather than hard tailoring.
- Transparent bubble helmets are made from an impact and pressure resistant polycarbonate.

Life support for a space suit is packaged with atmosphere control, electrical power, communications and thermal control. These capabilities can be provided using umbilicals or Portable (sometimes called "primary") Life Support Systems (PLSSs).

x Umbilicals such as those used in the Gemini and Skylab can offer certain application advantages:
- The systems are simpler and cheaper because they utilize services and gases from the host facility.
- They reduce carry weight for the astronauts because they use no backpacks.
- They can be used to augment or substitute for a PLSS on part of the mission or for emergency operations.
- Umbilicals connected to landers or rovers minimize use of backpack consumables during transit.
- Umbilicals can offer "buddy breathing" capabilities during emergencies.

x The PLSS offers much greater range and mobility than is afforded by umbilicals:
- It is often referred to as a "backpack" and provides EVA crew members with oxygen for breathing, pressurization, ventilation, and water for cooling.
- The PLSS is made of fiberglass, and provides mountings for other EMU components, including a secondary Suit Oxygen Package (SOP).
- The primary oxygen system and water bladders can support 7 hours inside the EMU, and the SOP can extend suit pressure for 30 minutes if needed.

Atmosphere Control:
x The Shuttle's EMU uses bottles of compressed O2 to provide breathing through a dual-mode, singlestage regulator that reduces pressure to 29.6 kPa:
- Emergency O2 systems protect users from critical failures (loss of primary O2, suit leakage or an inoperable ventilation fan motor.)
- Operation is automatic, beginning when pressure falls below 27 kPa for leakage rates up to 2.36 kg/ hour (enough margin to avoid the bends).
x A fan directs the air supply over the user's face to carry off expired CO2:
- CO2 is removed from the ventilation flow stream by lithium hydroxide (LiOH) for the Shuttle, and by a reusable metal oxide canister for ISS.
- Activated charcoal absorbs contaminants in replaceable canisters.

Cooling:
x Air flow keeps the dew point of exhaled breathing gas in the helmet below the helmet's wall temperature to avoid fogging:
- A sublimator dehumidifies the ventilation flow stream and cools both the ventilation gas and the liquid flowing in the cooling ventilation garment.
- The sublimator is a 3-fluid heat exchanger that rejects heat to space by sublimating ice to vacuum.
- Feedwater to replenish ice is stored as a consumable in the PLSS's water tanks. (Condensate makes up about 0.9 kg. or 18% of the feedwater supply.)
- Water cooling at 18% suppresses most perspiration to prevent dehydration.
- Crews can select cooling between 16oC33oC. (The Shuttles EMU provides 2.05 kWh cooling with an average rate of 293 W, and a 15 minute peak rate of 586 W.)

Electrical Systems and Equipment:
x Electrical and electronic systems include electrical power, data management and communications (audio and visual):
- The Shuttles EMU and Russia's Orlan DMA suit both use silver-zinc batteries.
- The Russian system uses replaceable batteries with 19 A. H at 27 Vdc.
- The US EMU uses rechargeable batteries that provide a 26.6 A. H at 16.8 Vdc power system.
- Since a fire in a suit's pure oxygen environment would be catastrophic, the US EMU has separate PLSS and suit enclosures.
x Displays and controls provide information needed for mission tasks and suit health assessments:
- The EMU has a single-line, 20-character LCD mounted on the chest to report status.
- Additional capabilities proposed for lunar / Mars missions include an electronic cuff checklist, an external helmetmounted display, and an integrated pair of voice-activated LCD monitors.

- For the Shuttle, Mir and ISS, airlocks are places where suits are stowed, donned / doffed and serviced.
- In weightlessness, crews can float through a 1 meter diameter opening, while in partial-gravity where the crew walks vertically, hatches should be dimensioned taller for vertical ingress and egress.
- For lunar / planetary operations, airlocks should provide means for dust removal.

The Shuttle airlock is located in the crew cabin mid-deck enabling transfers into the payload bay. It is a 150 cubic ft. volume (63 inch diameter x83 inches long) and can accommodate two fully-suited astronauts.

3. After a seal is accomplished, the interior of the hatch is purged to remove any dust or other contamination.
4. When the purge is complete, it is safe to open the hatch to the vehicle interior.

x Dust contamination control: - Since Suitlocks attach to the outside of the habitats, dust which collects on suits during EVAs will not be brought into crew compartments upon return.

Safe and effective EVA operations under weightless conditions depend upon appropriately planned restraint systems:
x Tethers:
- ISS EVA astronauts are attached to the station by two 55 ft. long waist tethers and a wrist tether at all times for safety purposes.
- The standard protocol is to always make a new connection before any connection is broken.
- A tether connected to the mini workstation (MWS) attached to the front of the EMU is used to connect an EVA crew member to a worksite, and can be used for translation of tools and small parts required for mission tasks.

Transporting EVA crew groups over longer distances in low-gravity environments (such as on Mars' moons Phobos and Deimos) may apply maneuvering unit principles.
x A Phobos Maneuvering Unit (PMU) might transport EVA crews of 2-4 several kilometers from the spacecraft landing location:
- The gravity of Phobos (about 0.001 Earth gravity) would be too low to walk on, and an extremely small amount of thrust would be required for a "hopper" to be used.
- The moon's small diameter (maximum 28 km) will limit travel distances, but will also present radio communication challenges. (The horizon will be only 270 meters away for a tall man standing.)

x A proposed unpressurized multipurpose vehicle to transport people and cargo between LEO facilities:
- Can be delivered in a dedicated Space Shuttle Orbiter or Russian Proton launch.
- Maneuverable under automated, teleoperated or manual control.
- Serves as an open "pickup truck" to transport space-suited crews, manipulate space station module-sized elements and support construction/assembly processes.
x Special design features include:
- A Remote Manipulator System (RMS) for teleoperated or manual control.
- Air supply to supplement EVA life support capacities.

Numerous concept studies in connection with the Apollo Program propose pressurized lunar vehicles capable of supporting small crews over EVAs lasting a few weeks:
x The Grumman Mobile Lunar Laboratory (MOLAB) vehicle was created as a mockup on a full-size working chassis: - The vehicle was designed to support a crew of 2 for periods up to 6 weeks. - It would be capable of operating as an excursion habitat, and also as a prime mover to tow unpressurized trailers. - A variation of the design was an unpressurized rover option.

Options include primary vehicles that pull trains of auxiliary units vs. primary vehicles traveling together.
x Short-range lunar vehicles were estimated to require 5-10 kW average power, possibly using batteries.
- A Dynamic Isotope Power Supply (DIPS) was considered as an alternative power source to reduce weight. (The nuclear device would use a plutonium isotope heat source with a small heat source power converter.)
- The favored power option was to use Shuttle-type liquid oxygen ­ hydrogen fuel cells. Current cell life, however, is only about 2,000 hours.

Short Apollo and Shuttle missions have enabled crews to be trained on Earth for all scheduled EVA procedures and anticipated contingencies. This will be more difficult to accomplish for much longer ISS and lunar/ planetary missions.

x Shuttle training consists of classroom work, suited water tank weightless simulation, parabolic flights that induce short periods of weightlessness or reduced-gravity, and training exercises using various simulators and mockups:
- Training requires about 1 year, with hardware available about 9 months before flight.
- Crews can refer to pre-prepared paper checklists worn on suit forearm cuffs.

x Some ISS and lunar/Mars expedition training may have to be conducted during the missions:
- NASA is developing a Virtual Reality (VR) training capability that can be applied on Earth and in space.
- An electronic cuff checklist is also being developed for real-time EVA support, which will be updatable from Earth during a mission.
