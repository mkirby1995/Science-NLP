"For millinean earth inhabitants have lifted their eyes and their

minds skyward or spaceward to seek benefits in the form of divine

intervention and guidance whether to augment their Earthen life or

alleviate their Earthen problems. Until recently for the enlightened,

and until now for many others in the present world, the skies

beyond the clouds still represent a realm of deep mystery where

super human exploits are not impossible. It would not be an

overstatement to say that man now has more reasons to look

upward to space for enhancement of his terrestrial existence.

Space being over us all, no matter our creed, color or stage of development, no matter where we live - be it on the highest mountain or in the remotest valley, be it in a landlocked country or on an island - space is always there above us, in equal proximity to any inhabitant on this planet. The sun, the moon, the stars, and the entire space inventory, have been a part of man's life since his creation. Unlike the oceans, space affects all people with equal intensity, and is a conditio sine qua non for his Uvelihood."
from: International Developments in Space Stations and Space Technologies. American Institute ofAeronautics and Astronautics

Before dealing with the implicit variations in the difference between architectural space and the physicality of astronautical space one must look at the inherent similiarities.

The excerpt above taken from R. Sunaryo, space is described as being there above us all, in equal proximity to any inhabitant of this planet. According to this observation one can look at architectural space being there amid us all. Ready to be used, modified, exploited or enhanced, architectural space is just as tangible, it is just generally not thought of in the esoteric terms one usually

applies to aeronautical space. Architectural space, as an isolated entity, without the inputs donated by man, is hardly void. This is also true of aeronautical space, the only difference being the vast disparity between the scales. Untouched architectural space is never empty. The soil found below or the space above is teaming with possibility. The natural landforms or vegetation make up the framework for exploring architectural strategies. In outer space, the same framework or guidelines are set up, but one must look greater distances to view them. Asteriods, stars, suns and moons must frame or enhance the strategies pursued.
Perhaps the greatest concern for the aeronautical space designer is the absolute and unforgiving hostility of the environment. It is in this arena where architectural and aeronautical spaces truly diverge. In some instances architectural spaces are hostile, but compared to the alien frigidity of outer space these areas become merely a walk in the woods.
Another very important issue in the design of a space station is the present denial and insignificance of architectural imaging. The aesthetics of space dictate a sterile approach to the relationships between form and function. Larry Bell, when asked the question on image in in designing for space, stated, "You can't be concerned with image making." My goal and ultimately my thesis is to overcome this denial of image in an orbiting space station. Architecture is an art to evoke the senses in a feast of images and possibilities. The architect has the tools and the background to use the images that surround him and create an environment which is a footprint of his life, his culture, and his aspirations.

Delineation of the Need
President Reagan has recently announced a national goal of building a permanent manned space station in Earth orbit. This is not a new idea, with Skylab before it, along with the dreams of many space enthusiasts. The idea of space manufacture has also been with us for a few years, with early material processing experiments carried on by the Apollo astronauts.
Many people see a space station only in terms of its military potential. There are also many potential peaceful uses, in fact some like G. Harry Stine see space based manufacture as a third industrial revolution; mechanization and automation being the first two revolutions. Among the peaceful uses of a space station are the monitoring of Earth resources, especially crops, and as a base for astronomers. A third, and perhaps most important, is space based manufacture. This is very important for a variety of reasons, the most obvious being pollution. Taking the long view, a permanent space station is viewed by space enthusiasts as a mere stepping stone, as the gate to the rest of the solar system and beyond. With materials hauled into earth orbit from the moon or asteriod belt, much of the material needed to build ships to explore the solar system will not have to be hauled up out of the Earth's gravity as well.
Closer to the real world, there are four sound reasons for locating manufacturing facilities in space. Free power is the first, with unlimited solar energy, virtually unlimited power is available at what it costs to build the facility. Control of temperature in the manufacturing process is another. Free vacuum is the third, with control of gravity being the fourth. Together they will present a totally different climate for industrial development. They will permit the manufacture of alloys that are not possible in a gravity field, the growth of ultra-pure crystals for the electronic industry, and the production of materials tiiat need not touch the sides of containers they are processed in. The

Delineation of the Need possibilities seem endless. We know that we can alloy aluminum and zinc in orbit and that ultra-pure crystals can be grown. This thesis deals with a fantasy which is blooming into reality on a daily basis. It is architecture addressing technology and high-tech revolutions, it is possibility and it is reality, it is fantasy - but a fantasy which is manifesting itself in reality. We do not know what constitutes reality and what is only fantasy in space. We have not been in space long enough to discover what the real advantages are to being there are vet.

The initial space station will consist of the following capabilities: laboratories, habitat, resources, multiple berthing, services, platforms, and support services. These capabilities will be transported to space by the space shuttle. The Shuttle will also be used to assemble these capabilities in space. Technologies for the space station deal with all of the housekeeping functions necessary to perform the above capabilities. The functions have been divided into ten disciplines: control and life support, data management, power, thermal, attitude control and stabilization, onboard propulsion, structures and mechanisms, human capabilities, and communications. This program will discuss the space station from a systems perspective. It will discuss: the application of automation to improve the space station's routine housekeeping and operations efficiency, the technologies to improve the effectiveness of man's participation in space operations, the priority of application of estimated technology effort required in each discipline, and in some cases, the application of technology to specific components and subsystems.
The space station user communities have also defined advanced technology needs. The users have been grouped into four areas: science and applications, commercial, national defense, and technology development missions. As the user communities mature, the technology needed to enable man to optimize uses of the space station will become more clearly defined. As the space station becomes operational, it will provide the equivalent of a new research facility specializing in developing advanced technologies that relate to space vacuum and micro-gravity.
Investigation of technology missions on an operational space station have established over 150 potential experiments. These experiments deal with such things as: characteristics of fluids in micro-g, characterization of the combined

radiation effects of space, evaluation of the characteristics of space plasma, etc. This program discusses the technology developments required for the operational space station to enable future technology experiments.
The program concludes with an overview of NASA technology planning to support the initial space station and to support the evolutionary growth of the space station.
In the future of an operational manned space station and an operational Shuttle, the technologist is challenged to provide new innovative techniques to enable new functions such as on-orbit servicing of space assets, on-board maintenance and repair of space station functions, on-board command and control, space resupply of space-based orbital transfer vehicles, performance of long duration space experiments, development of space manufacturing techniques, etc. These functions are to be accomplished on-board a manned space station that is maintained in orbit by on-board maintenance and supported by logistics from the Shuttle. The space station will be designed to include features to enable economical evolutionary growth and technological upgrade by space manufacture of required materials. This space station will consist of many of the activities one might find in any small township or community, the major difference being of course the scale and cost of construction.
The design approach for the evolutionary space station is to first envision the function and configuration of the growth station, and then to configure the initial space station to include the early functions and the necessary "scar" to enable an economic evolutionary growth space station by block changes (Figures 1 and 2). After the placement of the core block assembly, an extensive program for the development of a mega structure to house the factory for the

Strategyfor Design
The power for this facility is to be supplied by large solar arrays and isothermal generators (Power options are discussed in greater detail under the technology discipline entitled Power). NASA's plans to build a huge electronic mail facility can and should be incorporated into the solar array. This will save money on the base structure requirements and also benefit from the necessary orientations to the sun and Earth, being that the requirements necessitate an 160° out-of-phase shift.
The definition phase of the space station includes extensive requirements analysis and system definition and a parallel technology/advanced development program. The technology/advanced development program objective is to mature pending technologies to a state-of-maturity so that new techniques can be substituted into the baseline design to improve performance or reduce cost. A "technology option" is defined as a "technological innovation that has been matured to a sufficient level-of-development to be considered as acceptable flight hardware". The technologies applicable for IOC must be judged promising by the beginning of the Phase C authority to proceed (ATP) and must reach the status of a "technology option" shortly after the preliminary design review (PDR) of Phase C (Figure 3).^ If a technology development is promising but does not achieve the status of a "technology option" in time for IOC, it can continue in development and be incorporated in the space station growth mission by a block change.
The technologist's view of a space station is the integrated functional performance of ten major subsystems. Figure 4 lists the space station

As the subsystem simulation is validated with flight hardware, it will be combined into a total space station simulation that will represent the total space assembled space station system performance. The flight space station hardware will be instrumented (as defined by the system simulation) and the system simulation will be calibrated with flight data. This calibrated system simulation will become the ground representation of the on-orbit measured performance.

Operations technology includes operational analysis that defines high-leverage technology options that should be matured specifically to reduce operations cost. For example, on-board maintenance requires an extensive amount of on-board data and documentation. The architecture and packaging of the on-board data base, that permits easy access to the proper data to support on-orbit repair of random failures, is part of the operations technology task.

outside NASA to meet

commercial markets. The

challenge to NASA is to supplement the commercial crew innovations with

tasks that will let NASA exploit the exploding market by using the latest

techniques in configuring a space station data system architecture that will

meet the space station system performance requirements. One major

difficulty in such a rapidly changing technological environment is in designing

a data system that is the beginning of an evolving system to be in operation in

excess of 20 years. With the rapid obsolescence of parts (approximately every

2 years), the data system architecture must be sufficiently modularized to

accept technological upgrade transparent to the user.

The data system will define a standard operating system and a standard hardware interface (bus interface unit, BIU) to each of the space station subsystems and users. The BIU will contain a common processor which will be a member of a technologically advancing family of processors each with increasing computational capability and expanding memory. One such processor is the 16 bit mil-spec 1750a and 32 bit 1862. The core DMS consists of a distributed network of BIU's where each BIU has one or more processors. The number of processors in a BIU is a function of the degree of fault tolerance required and the total computational capability necessary to support the core DMS at that node. NASA is currently developing a very high speed integrated circuit (VHSIC) 1750A processor with 5 million operations per second capability and a pipeline coprocessor with 10 million floating point operations per second.

The core DMS (Figure 12)

is viewed as being

incorporated in a network

of BIU's using a distributed

The BIU functions as a

own unique hardware/software to run on the DMS foundation. The use of a common language such as ADA will provide a cost-effective efficient process for integration of all subsystems into the total on-board capabilities. In addition, the BIU's provide the linkage to a higher order language (ADA and interpreters) and standard software tools. By the use of common high-level user control/test/validation language and standard user gateways to the core DMS and to the user subsystem, the user space station system can look identical to the user ground system.

Power'' NASA has had a well organized electrical power system technology program for higher power requirements (Figure 13) and has several maturing techniques to offer as "technology options" for the IOC space station. The program can

choose between advanced

photovoltaic power generation techniques such as gallium arsenide (GaAs)

cells with concentrators or an improved planar silicon cell with a back grid on

a flexible superstrate blanket that offers approximately 20 percent

improvement in efficiency and 40 percent reduction in alkaline fuel cells

(water electrolysis) or advanced nickel hydrogen batteries for power storage.

Regenerative fuel cells show an improvement over conventional nickel

cadmium batteries by approximately 300 percent. Nickel hydrogen batteries

show an improvement over nickel cadmium batteries by approximately 350

percent.

The large area of solar arrays required to meet the forecasted large power

a program for space 1 6

Strategyfor Design
requirements (200-300 kw) for the growth station, has caused considerable interest in a solar thermal dynamic power conversion system. In this case, energy would be received and stored as heat. The heat energy will be converted to electricity by dynamic machinery such as the Brayton Cycle turbocompressor engine, the organic rankine or the free piston Stirling engine. The solar collector for a thermal dynamic system is considerably smaller than an equivalent photovoltaic solar array and, therefore, desirable because of the reduction in aerodynamic drag on the space station. Before the solar dynamic power system can be specified for space station application, there are several technological issues that must be resolved including life of the surface of the energy collector, engine reliability and life, and the performance of heat storage.

The major power system technological challenge for the IOC and growth space station is to find the optimum path (Figure 14) through the power system technology options for the IOC space stations and the first block of an evolutionary path to the desired growth station.

This isothermal two-phase

allows on-orbit changes in the system without breaking any fluid connections.

There are several cold plate designs that have been built and evaluated in the laboratory. A typical cold plate design is a sandwich type construction with heat pipes welded internal to the sandwich. A typical mechanical connection uses a high pressure (100-150 pounds) contact that has demonstrated heat transfer coefficient as high as 500 BTU/HR/FT.

Prototypes of this design have been built and successfully tested in the laboratory. Long-length heat transport can be accomplished by heat pipes (demonstrated over 50 ft.) and a pumped two phase thermal loop (Figure 16). Heat rejected is accomplished by a heat pipe radiator. The radiator sections are similar to the two phase cold plate described earlier.

A major thermal technology challenge is in the constructable radiator. It is planned to demonstrate this technology in a Shuttle flight experiment in the 1988-1999 time frame.

IOC space station that can

provide attitude stability of that element and also provide stability for several

major changes in plant during the assembly and build up of four to six

elements to complete the space station IOC assembly on orbit. This same

control system must also accept additional changes to enable specification

control of the IOC space station through all of the interim configuration

changes to the growth configuration.

Techniques such as system identification, distributed control, and adaptive

control are being developed to provide a control system to adjust to meet such

a broad range of performance (Figure 18).

These techniques can be

analyzed, simulated, and synthesized. Hardware dynamics can be integrated into the laboratory simulation tests. Scale models can be tested. But it is unlikely that a full scale space station control system will be available for ground

A major technology challenge to the control systems designer is to establish the technique to validate a control system design that will provide an adequate level of confidence that the control system will operate satisfactorily in space. Several techniques will be traded from ground tests to a Shuttle flight test to instrumentation and evaluation of each element of the space station as it is launched.

Auxilliary Propulsion^® It is envisioned that the on-board propulsion system used for orbit maintenance and momentum management will consist of two levels of thrusters. A H2O2 chemical engine in the 25-100 pound class and a resistojet in the 1 pound class. The major technology task for each class of thruster is shown in Figure 19. The gaseous hydrogen-oxygen system consists of a propellant conditioning system, vaporizer, and a storage system.

Technology development tasks also include a health monitoring system that continuously monitors critical parameters such as component performance, fluid leaks, and temperatures and pressures throughout the system.

A resistojet is a low thrust monopropellant thruster that gains specific impulse by adding heat energy to the fuel. Various fuels may be used. It is most advantageous if waste products can be used as fuel. The low thrust is designed to operate nearly continuously for acceleration control.

Structures, Materials,
and Mechanisms^^ The key features of this technology program are shown on Figure 20. A major technology task in materials is the development of new composite materials that are designed to resist penetration from high velocity particles (man made debris or meteoroids) traveling at velocities of

10-20 km/sec. Analysis and simulation will be validated by high velocity tests to be run in existing NASA facilities. Material thickness will be evaluated from 1mm to 10mm thick. Various designs and bumper configurations will be evaluated to determine a family of designs to minimize particle penetration. The results of composite high-speed particle tests will be compared with an existing data base for aluminum. Space debris testing is planned to be conducted in 1985-1986 which will provide additional data to the existing space debris data base and wil provide valuable realistic space penetration characteristics to compare with ground test and simulation.
Deployable and erectable structure techniques are a major building block for space station construction in orbit and represent a significant part of the structures technology program. Work is continuing on both techniques. It is assumed that EVA will be available for routine operations in space. Timeline for space operations is an evaluation criteria in the comparative tradeoff studies between these two techniques; but no penalty is assigned to the amount of EVA time required. The major technology challenge for erectable structure configurations is the design of structural joints asembled in space. They must be free enough to enhance the assembly process and rigid enough to provide the structural ridgidity specifications. A major disadvantage and, therefore, a technology challenge to improve, is the difficulty of integrating space station resources into the structure (such as copper and/or optic harnesses and structural hard points). Erectable structures have an advantage of their high density packaging for launch. The deployable design does permit some integration of space station services into the structure, but at the expense of the launch packaging density. Deployables tend to require less on-orbit assembly time compared to erectables. Both techniques are being developed. It is envisioned that bodi techniques will be used on this space station.

A third area in this technology is mechanisms. The technology in mechanism design is to acheive reliabilty over long life (approaching twenty years) operating in the environment of space. Much of this program deals with basic research in bearing seals and lubricants. The unique applications technology challenge is to develop mechanism configuration alternatives to meet classes of requirements such as gimbal drivers for solar arrays and thermal radiators, umbilicals and signal and power transfer across active joints, etc. Development of mechanical systems kinematic analysis capability including elastic effects and accumulation of tolerances across the environmental range will provide valuable improved design tools. A major space station focus for the mechanism technology program is the Shuttle/space station berthing mechanism.

technology challenge of this program is to partition the human function between the man and the machine, between the man's role to be accomplished internal to the vehicle, and to develop aids

(tools, fixtures, crew

activities. This task also

deals with the habitability

a program for space 2 3

Strategyfor Design
development of basic design data such as space anthropometry, methods for formating support documentation, and methods for allocating tasks between man and machine.
Crew station design focuses on the application of advanced display and control technology, (flat panel displays, touch sensitive panels, voice recognition/synthesis, etc.), and basic ingredients for comfort. The ideas of comfort in space are not too different from the ideas of comfort on Earth.
Temperature. When there is not too much physical activity, 72° F is considered ideal. Variations should not exceed 5° waarmer or cooler. Environmental-control systems of the spacecraft can easily maintain the temperature within this range, however long the stay in space.
Atmosphere. Present-day U.S. spacecraft provide a pure-oxygen atmosphere to breath at the low pressure of less than 5 pounds per square inch (absolute). This is about one third of the normal atmospheric pressure (14.9 pounds per square inch), and is like that located atop Mount Everest. But a breath of pure oxygen at 5 pound pressure gives the lungs enough - more oxygen, in fact, than is in a breath of three-times-denser normal air (21 percent oxygen, 79 percent nitrogen). The low pressure, besides saving spacecraft weight, gives space suits maximum flexibility to make wearers' movements easy. Using the same pressure in spaceccraft cabins and space suits avoids complications in changing from one to the other - for a spacewalk or in case a sudden failure of the cabin's pressure system forces the astronauts to close their helmets' faceplates or don their helmets and depend on the life giving atmosphere in their suits.
As to how long astronauts can breath pure oxygen without harm, however,
a program for space 2 4

Strategyfor Design
there is considerable argument. The Gemini 7 flight proved that two weeks is acceptable and several Apollo flights lasting ten days confirmed that finding. But how about three months or even three years? No one really knows. Therefore, for a lack of experience the space station will be designed to incorporate a closed loop system of pressurization and environmental control. This means the system will use the 40 percent oxygen and 60 percent nitrogen mixture, close to that found in the Earth environment. Pressure will be strictly maintained at 13.5 pounds per square inch. This pressure is roughly equivalent to the pressure found in Mile High Stadium in Denver, Colorado.
Privacy. Individuals value the right to be left alone. After a year in space in crowded quarters even the simplest nuance of behaviour can be irritating.
The Space Station will be comprised of two main divisions. One will be the microgravity area for the factory, (the workplace), and the other will be the artificial gravity area for living, sleeping, socializing, and eating. The sleeping quarters will be built to insure each occupant the privacy one might find in a college dormitory. Separate areas will be provided to allow the workers, scientists and astronauts to interact socially. The central navigational and command center will also be located within the artificial gravity sector. Food. Dehydrated and powdered food - reconstituted by moistening, kneading, and squeezing - may be fine for heroic explorers. But a man expected to perform at top efficiency in space for a year or more should get the same filet-mignon treatment as the business traveler on a flight from New York to Los Angeles.
Entertainment. We all need diversion. A man in a space station, will want something to listen to, or look at - whether it is the Beetles or Beethoven,
a program for space 2 0

Strategyfor Design
Playboy or Plutarch. Advanced techniques offer ways to keep our space workers happy and balanced: taped music, microfilm libraries, laser for interplanetary color television.
Medical care. For a two week trip to the moon and back an astronaut need only to check in with his flight surgeon for a prompt okay. But that will not suffice for a one year stay in orbit. Anyone can have a toothache or catch a serious disease a few months after his doctor found him in perfect health. So it stands to reason that long stays in outer space will require a physician at hand. And astronaut-doctors will become a part of the space faring community, just as astronaut astronomers, astronaut meteorologists, and astronaut clergymen will. All of these specialist will require their own work areas just as the research personnel will.
Gravity. Astronauts Borman and Lovell were perfectly happy after two weeks of microgravity. Their comments sounded almost as if their major concern was whether or not they would ever get used to the nuisance of Earth gravity again. Medical experts still do not know what three months or a year of microgravity will do to a man. It is for this reason that artificial gravity will be employed into the living quarters of the space station. This will necessitate a major architectural design focus on the transition between the two areas.
Outputs of this technology are design guidelines to be used in the design of all equipment that interfaces with the crew. An example of a design guideline is the requirement of the helmet mounted data display used to provide instructions to astronauts on EVA. This guideline must address such things as: the configuration of the display (direct vision, fringe vision, static or dynamic, etc.), the format of the data, the technique, the details of the data, rate of
a program for space 2 6

change of the data, multi-chaimel use, etc. These guidelines would be used in the design of helmet/display system, the software pocketization, communication interface, data management interface, space operational procedures, etc.

Communications^^ See Figure 22. Major technology tasks include: reduction in operational constraints by use of multi-access systems and phased array body, mounted antenna, improvement in performance by the optical space-to-space links, use of

20/30 GHz and 60 GHz for

tracking and rendevous to avoid the spectrum crowding/radio interference in

the S- and Ku- band frequencies.

Technology development in antenna systems is concentrated on spherical coverage for proximity operations, optical links to near and far targets, multi-use antenna covering S-, X-, and Ku- band. Technology options include beam switching, multibeam, and phased arrays. Potential multi access approaches include: packet-oriented time domain multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), frequency hop multiple access (FHMA), code division multiple access (CDMA), and space division multiple access (SDMA). These will be traded regarding cost and efficiency. Advanced laser ranging/tracking technology will be used for traffic control and

Microwave radars envisioned for multi-target acquisition and tracking will use distributed phase array antenna and high speed signal processing technologies for the IOC space station.

flexibility of the application of technologies to the space station program. If an

innovative new approach is desirable for IOC, but at the time the IOC

technology development can continue for later incorporation by block change.

Technology Themes The technology discussion by disciplines does not provide the complete perspective of the space station technology development program. A sample

a program for space 2 8

Strategyfor Design
cross-cut theme is presented here to illustrate the depth and breadth of the NASA space station technology program.
Automation is a technology category but it is not a discipline. It is a function that cross-cuts all of the space station disciplines. Hence, all of the discipline technologies will deal with the application of automation. Automation technology is being approached in three parallel ways: (1) Discipline technology deals with automation techniques such as the development of new appraoches to automation, new algorithms, new languages, new techniques such as expert systems, and planners. It deals with technique rather than application; (2) Systematic top-down definition of automation ground rules deals with partitioning of functions between the space station and the ground. It includes the definition of mission rules, that is, the orderly decision of priority when the system faces a conflict or a contradiction; and (3) Bottoms-up automation analysis for specific subsystems. The power subsystem and the environmental control and life support subsystems are presently being studied. At the conslusion of these two studies, common or generic trends for the automated control of subsystems will be identified. This analysis of subsystem automation approaches will be combined with the top-down space station automation study to establish an automation requirement document of the entire space station.
User Needs The technology program includes technologies to assist in making the space station user friendly. NASA has a user group that is divided into three classes: (1) technology driver missions, (2) science and applications, and (3) commercial users. Each group is evaluating future space station uses and defining an envelope of user requirements. Technology planning has used the
a program for space 2 9

Strategy for Design
definition of user requirements to size the capacity of the space station resources. A good example of a technology development program to meet a user need is the technology to evaluate techniques to handle the transfer of cryofluids in zero-g. The technology has adddresed: (a) zero gravity fluid gaging, (b) reusable insulation for fluid transport, (c) leak-proof fluid coupling, (d) long term cryo storage on orbit, etc. The program has developed cryo-management, fluid-management, Shuttle flight test program that consists of several flight experiments.^^

This Space Stadon program is derived from the NASA plan FY 1985. The

NASA plan is the culmination of two years of planning that has grown from

the OAST generic base technology program (see Figure 24). The first step of this

program was to review the progress of the ongoing generic base technology program to determine what tasks where applicable to a

station "verticle cut" of the generic base. The second step was to modify those

tasks that would be more applicable to a space station anticipated need but still

preserve the generic application of those tasks to other platforms and large

space structures. The third step was to augment the generic base and focus the

output to a specific space station need and schedule. The fourth step was to seek

space station technologies emerging from the generic and focused technology

program to conduct advanced development evaluation of these technologies to

determine the applicability to the space station design. The fifth step was to establish discipline test beds to evaluate the advanced development hardware before a technology option decision was required. The sixth step was investigate STS flight tests for mature and/or demonstrated advanced technology performance. These results will be incorporated into the program and will be correlated in accordance with my anthropometric program.

Planning for large construction projects in space

There is widespread agreement that our future in space will include operation

of a variety of large complex systems which to one degree or another will

require "construction in space." These systems cover a wide range of

complexity aand timing. At the far end of the spectrum are multi-gigawatt

satellite solar power stations which could supply a substantial fraction of our

power needs on Earth by the end of the 21st century. At the near end of the

spectrum are large deployable antennas and sizable in-orbit power supplies

which will be needed to supply power in low Earth orbit in the early 1990's.

These trends and possible timing as now foreseen are summarized graphically in Figure 25.

We anticipate the need for dish shaped antennas as large as 300 meters in diameter for advanced communication purposes during the next decade or so. For that same period, scientists are considering dish shaped listening posts in space as large as 3000 meters in diameter to search for extraterrestial intelligence (SETI) or to detect faint RF sources of unknown origins. Similiarly, booms and planar surfaces hundreds of thousands of meters in extent are under consideration. Examples of these prospective systems are illustrated in Figures 26, 27, and 28. In particular, typical large structures for advanced communication and Earth sensing are shown.

Generally speaking, our large systems in space to date have used deployment principles to acheive their large size, although Gemini, Apollo, ASTP, and Skylab all used modular construction assembly to obtain their basic configuration. It is interesting to consider that in Skylab even the large sunshades used to effect in-orbit repair were deployed. In the case of the parasol-type sunshade first used, a combination of manual and automated deployment was employed. In the subsequent blanket sunshade, the entire deployment of the shade was done manually on to a manually assembled (tinker-toy style) framework (Figure 30).

The basic capability needed to construct things in spacer an addition to transportation is a work site or "construction camp." The Space Shuttle orbiter provides such an initial capability, as well as providing the basic transportation.

Strategyfor Design

Construction will be first carried out by assembly of earth built modules carried up in the Shuttle unassembled so as to fit within the cargo bay during launch or carried up by seperate shuttle flights and docked or joined in orbit much as was done on the Gemini, Apollo, Skylab and Apollo-Soyuz Programs. In these past programs, the seperate modules had the capability to maneuver and dock with each other by means of their own propulsion and stabilizing systems. For routine assembly operations in the near future, many of the elements or modules to be assembled will be passive and have to be externally manipulated or handled. To this end, the Shuttle has a remotely controlled manipulator system (RMS). The RMS is a manually controlled (servo-computer aided) from within the Shuttle by a human operator with direct visual or remote TV aided sensing and has the capability to reach 15 meters from the orbiter-mounted base. An extensive program of learning to use this versatile tool in space is required - first on the ground with zero gravity simulation through under-water or lighter-than-air buoyancy and later in test flights with

a program for space 3 6

Strategyfor Design
the actual system. An initial flight evaluation is plaimed on a Shuttle mission in the 1990's.
In addition to remotely controlled assembly, it will be necessary also to have on-site human support for some operations - either as a part of the planned assembly process or in a trouble-shooting or repair mode. The Shuttle orbiter provides "EVA" support for two crewman up to 6 hours at a time in such a mode.
In contrast with our lack of experience with remote manipulators in space, we have a comparative wealth of EVA experience, going back to Ed White's "spacewalk" in 1965 and culminating in the magnificent in-flight repair work carried out by Pete Conrad and his fellow crewmen during the Skylab program. From these experiences, we have a good understanding of basic EVA capabilities and effectiveness and primary future needs will be specific task training for new crewmen. Neutral buoyancy (underwater) and zero-g aircraft training will be used extensively in these areas as in the past. The next basic tool needed will be a free-flying teleoperator system which will provide manipulative support at distances not reachable by the attached shuttle RMS or in circumstances not conducive to EVA. Such a system is currently under development and will be useful for payload placement and planned or contingency payload retrieval, as well as construction support. Development and training in the use of such devices is aided greatly by the use of air-bearing three-degree-of-freedom flight simulators and neutral buoyancy simulators.
In-space fabrication, as opposed to in-space assembly or deployment, means forming structural members in orbit from coils of sheet or other stock carried
a program for space 0 /

Strategyfor Design
to orbit in bulk form. A simple analogy is the on-site fabrication of aluminum rain gutters for residential housing. Space fabrication has several advantages primarily increased volumetric efficiency in carrying structural metal into orbit and the fact that in zero-g, structural elements of practically unlimited length can be extruded. Very large space structures may require this technique. However, the practical or desirable limits or size of deployed or assembled structures are by no means known at this time. The tradeoffs among the several techniques must be carried out on a case-by-case basis. In any event, it is felt that in-space fabrication is an important option for future large space construction as well as developmental in-space evaluation of such devices, as illustrated in Figure 31. In this illustration, a large planar assembly is being formed of on-orbit extruded beams.
a program for space 3 8

Strategyfor Design
At this point, it becomes apparent that for extended assembly/construction operations, more electric power and duration will be needed than are available from the basic Shuttle. The electric power supply for the Shuttle is furnished by hydrogen/oxygen fuel cells and enough reactants can normally be carried to support mission durations on orbit of 7 to 12 days without intruding into the payload bay with cryogenic tank storage. For longer missions, added cryogenic storage can be provided in the payload bay ~ however, at the cost of payload bay weight and volume. An alternative solution, currently under study, is a space-stored electric power module which would be carried into orbit by the Shuttle where it would remain as a constant source of power and stabilization to orbiters docked with it. Such a power module uses a large deployed solar array. This array with a total area of 600 square meters and a span of 70 meters - substantially larger than the previous largest system flown (the Skylab array) would provide an average power of 25 KW (59 KW full sun) to the orbiter - essentially providing unlimited duration in orbit as far as electric power is concerned. In addition, the module would provide attitude stabilization and control to the orbiter through control moment gyroscopes mounted in the module. The solar array application of large deployble structures presents no particular problem of precision of Figure control or in pointing - the tolerances in both these areas being substantial. In this instance, the dominant requirements are low unit weight, and adequate strength to withstand maneuvering, docking and deployment loads. The basic orbiter with its hydrogen/oxygen fuel cells can provide about 7 KW of power for 30 days to the payload for this configuration. However, the cryo tanks take up substantial orbiter payload volume and substract about 16,000# from the available orbiter payload for this mode of operation. With the power module connected and the fuel cells shut down or "idling," about 11 KW of power can be supplied for 60 or more days-limiting factor now being food, water and
a program for space 3 9

Strategyfor Design
other crew habitability requirements for the longer duration. In addition, the cryo tanks for this approach do not intrude into payload volume or substract from basic payload capability. This 25 KW power module is now under detailed definition and is being planned for 1984 availability. The 25 KW power module has several other attractive features. One is the potential it offers for support of high power free-flying payloads in a detached mode from the orbiter. The system will be configured with dual docking ports so that free-flying payloads can remain attached while the module is attached to the shuttle. In addition to the role of the power module in supporting construction and operation of larger and more complex systems in orbit, it offers the potential for substantially enhanced Spacelab missions starting in the third and fourth year of Spacelab operations. Typical baseline orbiter-Spacelab misions operate 12 days, with about 35 KW of power available to the Spacelab payload, after orbiter-Spacelab housekeeping needs are taken care of and with the payload weight and volume penalties discussed earlier. On the other hand, with the 25 KW power module in use, a power of 7 KW can be provided for duration of 60 days or longer with essentially full payload volume and weight. NASA and ESA have agreed to pursue coordinated studies of the 25 KW power module use with Spacelab for these longer duration-higher power missions.
A longer term possibility for cooperative effort, offered by the 25 KW module is the concept of a spacelab modified to have free-flying capability, with attitude control and power capabilities provided by the 25 KW power module. Such a facility could provide long duration on-orbit capability with periodic resupply of food, water and other expendables by the shuttle. NASA and ESA have recognized this potential and further agreed to keep each other informed about related studies of user needs and system configurations.
a program for space 4 0

Strategyfor Design
The benefits to the user of the longer duration-higher power spacelab missions are many. Not the least of these will be economy - greatly reduced cost per day of experiment operations. In fact, for representative projected experiment requirements, our calculations indicate that in the 1988-90 period the power module can repay its total cost of development during its first year of operation through more effective utilization of the Shuttle-Spacelab system. In addition, there are many experiments that require longer than 7 to 30 day continuous on-orbit operations to meet mission objectives. Typical of these are experiments involving solar cycle related phenomena, where uninterrupted observationover two or more solar cycles (28 days each) are required; and life science experiments where uninterrupted zero-g is required over successive generations of animal or plant specimens.
With the augmented Shuttle-Spacelab combination, a very substantial orbital capability will exist in 1984. However, the power level of 25 KW falls well short of expected needs for a number of applications in the mid to late 1990's. As now perceived, these higher powers will be required in areas such as:
° Advanced communications ° Experimental Evaluation of Solar
Power Satellite Parameters ° Materials Processing ° Advanced Space Propulsion
In the field of communications, of the order of a 100 KW may be required to power advanced systems such as the electronic mail concept or high power radars described in figure 26; several hundred KW will be required for proof of concept and evaluarion of Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) space to under wter
a program for space 4 1

Strategyfor Design communication systems. For an operational ELF system, powers of the order of several tens of megawatts could be required .
With regard to the solar power satellite (SPS), it has been estimated that several hundred KW will be required for evaluating factors such as power transmission efficiency, ionospheric heating effects of high power density on space structure. All of these data will be necessary as a part of evaluating the SPS system before any decision to proceed into the development of a large scale model or a full scale system.
In the area of materials processing, if we assume that early Spacelab experiments will lead to a prototype processing facility, a need for the powers of the order of 50 KW are needed. Such a prototype facility could evolve from Spacelab or be a completely new facility designed for free-flight and intermittant Shuttle attendance.
Finally in the area of advanced propulsion, electric powers in the lOO's of kilowatts will be required ultimately for operational systems. The likely first high power propulsion system will be an ion-drive for those missions requiring very high energy, such as rendezvous with the Encke comet. Subsequent uses for "ion drive" may include propelling large payloads from low to high orbit

Case Study 1
Several space systems which are too large to be transported into orbit fully assembled have been proposed in recent years. Such a system is the Space Station which is now an ongoing project. Many unprecedented challenges arise in the design and certification of such systems. Several of these challenges in the interdisciplinary area of structural dynamics and control were articulated in connection with requirements for three large systems, the Land Mobile Satellite System, the Large Deployable Reflector, and the Space Station. These represent the three classes of large space structures, all with different requirements, but all sharing similiar challenges in design and certification.
In antennas, needs for higher gains and higher operating frequencies combine to produce demands on ground testing which are increasingly difficult due to gravity. In the case of the space station, gravitational considerations may prevent a fully assembled ground vibration test. These situations force much greater reliance on analysis than in past programs. As a consequence of this broadly based requirement on analysis, much ongoing research is oriented to obtaining increased confidence in the ability to analyze the structures accurately. On realistic structures, verification of this ability is significantly inhibited due to prominent gravitational effects. Scale models are less subject to gravitational effects but their applicability suffers. Inabilities to scale joints properly and to scale members with dimensions already close to minimum gage. Because of these and other difficulties associated with ground testing in the orbital environment becomes necessary. The expense of such tests requires the careful selection of test structures and a well planned test program.
Eigensystem Realization Algorithm. The new in the Eigensystem Realization Algorithm (ERA) is an application of system realization theory to structural dynamics analysis. A matrix called the generalized Hankel matriz,
a program for space 4 3

Case Study 1
which represents the data structure in ERA, consists of Markoff parameters generated by free-decay responses. Using the singular value decomposition technique a linear model is then transformed into model space for model parameter identification.
The Galileo spacecraft is an interplanetary vehicle launched in 1986 for investigation of the chemical and physical composition of the planet Jupiter and its moons. It consists of a planetary orbiter and an atmospheric probe that will be deployed toward the planet. The ERA method has been applied to the Galileo spacecraft as part of a program conducted by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory to compare results of different dynamic data reduction methods. About 30 modes were identified in a frequency range of 10 to 50 Hz.
The solar array flight experiment was flown on the space shuttle. Objectives of the solar array flight experiment were to obtain space performance data on various types of solar cells along with a comparison of that data with ground test, to verify the method of 0-g deployment of the array and to verify two methods for obtaining dynamic data. One experiment methhod, not discussed here, involving reflectors and a charge-coupled device was conducted by the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. The other method involving the use of the on-board shuttle video cameras and photogrammetic analysis of the motion of the white circular targets shown in the figure was performed by the Langley Research Center. In this data analysis procedure synchronized video tapes are stored frame-by-frame and subsequently each frame is analyzed to determine a location of the set of targets on the array. Then a photogrammetric analysis is performed to locate in space and as a result a time history is generated. This time history can be analyzed by any of several data analysis mediods.

Case Study 1
Hoop-Column Antenna Concept. A significant challenge to both ground test and analysis is presented by the Hoop Column Antenna. This structure, known as the Hoop-Column Antenna Concept consists of a telescoping antenna mast which supports cables coimecting to an outer compression ring. Thus all members of the structure are in tension except for two compression members. The anteima mast is attached to the outer compression ring. The curved shape of the mesh is affected by a cable network connected to the central mast. This structure has been built to a diameter of 15 meters and will be tested electronically and then tested at the NASA Langley Research Center.
Test definition of the vibration characteristics of this structure obviously is complicated by the presence of so many tension members which will be difficult to instrument. In addition, access to the mesh modes is inhibited by the presence of these cables. The presence of gravity significantly affects the vibration effects of the cables in a known way, increasing frequencies of the upper support cables while decreasing those of the lower cables. Natural frequencies associated with the modes involving motion of the compression ring will be affected, but to a lesser extent.
Exact Member, Repeating Segment Analysis. Analysis of such a structure as the Hoop-Column antenna concept by usual finite element methods is very difficult because of the large number of degrees-of-freedom in this structure. An analysis has been developed however, which makes use of the reperitive nature of the structure and exact member theory. In this analysis only one repeating member is analyzed using exact member theory. Only the repeating segment is described in the analysis computer program but natural
a program for space 4 5

Case Study 1
frequencies for the complete structure can be generated. Cable motion and beams with significant preload are treated. Analysis of a typical repeating structure is indicated in which a structure similiar to a bicycle wheel is analyzed. Because of the exact nature of the elements, no intermediate nodes are needed between connections for analysis of the repeating segment. Results for this analysis show the lowest frequency as a function of preload. Thus, as preload is increased, the cable frequencies rise as indicated in the left portion of the figure while frequencies associated with the ring motion become the lowest frequency and eventually drops to zero as indicated in the right portion of the figure. When this frequency becomes zero, buckling occurs. This analysis will be the primary tool used to analyze the 15m Hoop-Column Anterma for comparison with ground test data.
Certification Issues for Large Space Structures Projects that require that very large structures be assembled or deployed in space present many perturbations to usual engineering development procedures. For example, orbital assembly requires that scenarios and timelines be known with confidence in order to plan for the necessary resources on orbit. Such data at present are almost non-existent. Development of reliable mathematical representations of structural behaviour also becomes much more difficult. The presence of gravity and atmosphere cause much of the ground test data to become suspect or invalid. Thus a thrust of research should be to improve the ability to perform ground tests. This can be done by improving suspension systems, extending the ability to predict gravitational effects, and callibrating ground test data through carefully planned orbital experiments. Several of the options are incorporated into the proposed space station mathematical model development logic. The program begins with more fundamental information being generated early. More focused, complex
a program for space 4 6

Case Study 1
testing is accomplished later in the program. Options include both full-scale component and subassembly tests, and scale model tests in a comprehensive ground test program. Probably the only fully assembled vehicle data obtained prior to flight will be the model data. Certainly this is the case for evolutionary configurations.
The generic space station model consists of a cylindrical habitation module, two solar arrays, each containing six panels providing a total span of 9m tip-to-tip, and a simulated thermal control panel vertically in the figure. The central joint is specially designed so that various relative orientations of the components can be realized. Slewing of the solar arrays will be accomplished with various torque motors located at the root of each solar array.
Actuators. A major difficulty in the implementation of most of the new technology in active vibration control in the presence of large slewing motions is the absence of specially designed actuators for this application. A mast actuator with internal electronics will produce a force proportional to the negative of the velocity. The sensor electronics and the effector all are contained within the one device. At the right of the figure is a grillage structure on which several of these vibration suppressors will be placed to act simultaneously to demonstrate their effectiveness for closely spaced modes. A typical output of the device is shown at the right of the figure as a time history. These actuators will be used in several laboratory test programs including the space station model just described and the control of flexible structures (COFS) program. Another difficulty in the certification of large structures is confirmation of the joints' structural integrity. In this figure typical test data is shown in the upper right. This data is taken from a static test of a typical structure joint. As shown in the figure the joint is nonlinear and has hysterisis.
a program for space 4 7

Case Study 1
This hysterisis is the source of most damping in large structures, but the nonlinearity introduces an unknown which must be accounted for analytically in the structural prediction. Because of the presence of gravity, interactions occur in ground tests and unknown preloads will occur during these tests on the joints which may alter the joint stiffness and thus the overall dynamics of the joint dominated structure. A ground test program to improve the ability to predict structural dynamics of joint dominated structures is now underway. This ground test program is part of the COFS program which has resulted from a NASA-industry assessment of the state-of-the-art for dynamics and control of large space structures. Other work emphasizing control of space structures has been underway in recent years. This work involved ground tests correlated with analysis and emphasized control design which accounts for the suppression of vibration of flexible structures.
The structure from which a mast is deployed is a reusable modified spacelab pallet being developed for use in the NASA Space Technology Experiments Program (STEP). The modifications are being made to provide several options to the experimenter. Experiments will be in the structures, structural dynamics, and controls disciplines. Reusable electronics for experiment control and data recording are part of the STEP pallet, thus effecting a large cost savings to the experimenter.
Careful tests and comparison with ground tests and associated analysis will produce a verified capability for the accurate prediction of joint dominated structures. A hoped for result of this program will be a capabilty to predict widi some degree of confidence the damping of a joint dominated structure in the orbital environment. The mast used in this first flight will be reflown with increasing emphasis on control technology development. The mast is the first
a program for space 4 8

Case Study 1
experiment which will be conducted in the STEP program. Contractor proposals for the mast are now being reviewed and the STEP pallet is under development. The NASA Langley Research Center will provide laision between the shuttle project and the experimenter. Concluding Remarks. In reviewing status and progress in the area of dynamics of large space structures, system identification, analysis of flexible structures, and certification of large space structures have been discussed. A new and promising technique for system identification utilizing free-decay time domain responses of large space structures has been developed and applied to both laboratory models and flight hardware with favorable results. The method is intended not only for applications in ground tests, but will be used in the analysis of flight data both on the OAST-1 Solar Array Flight just completed and in the mast program which is underway.
Facilities and instrumentation are in preparation for a challenging ground vibration test and analysis program on a new antenna concept called the Hoop-Column to be conducted in mid-1985 (this test was a part of the unsuccessful flight of the Space Shuttle Challenger, mission STS-51L). This antenna concept will be analyzed using an analysis which has been developed to the point of readiness for production applications. This analysis utilizes exact member tiieory, takes advantage of structural repetition, and can be applied in a much more efficient manner than usual finite element procedures. In addition, initial work to develop an advanced deployment and large motion simulation program has been described.
Implementation of vibration suppression techniques in tests has necessitated the development of actuators. One such actuator has been described which was developed in a coordinated NASA-university effort.

A comprehensive program in the area of structural dynamics and control of large space structures. Control of Flexible Structures (COFS) has been initiated which addresses the use of subscale models, subassemblies, and full-scale ground tests in the certification process, and compares results of these ground tests with results from flight tests in the orbital environment. Parallel analysis programs will aid the understanding of the experimental data and a capability to predict joint-dominated structures with confidence will result from this program.

Case Study 1
The Space Shuttle The shuttle has three main units: the orbiter, in which people and cargo travel between Earth and orbit; two solid rocket boosters that, together with the orbiters three main rocket engines, launch the entire system; and external fuel tank which supplies fuel to the orbiter engines. The orbiter returns to Earth like an airplane and can be used up to one hundred times. The boosters parachute into the sea and can also be reused.
Many commercial, scientific, and ecological services are provided by unmanned spacecraft carried into orbit by the orbiter and by experiments conducted onboard the orbiter. Many of these experiments will be accomplished by the use of a Spacelab, a complete scientific laboratory that remains bolted into the orbiter's payload bay. Spacecraft requiring higher orbits than the Shutles maximum altitude of about 1000 kilometers or intended for interplanetary missions are sent on their way by attached upper stage rockets.
Among the many services and benefits anticipated from Shuttle payloads are: timely and frequent global crop surveys that are fundamental to accurate crop forecasts; locating potential petroleum and mineral deposits; alerting officials
a program for space 51

Case Study 1
to air, land, and water pollution; location of potential fish concentrations; aiding ship transport bt pinpointing storms, icebergs, and other hazards and by discovering navigation passages through icefields; providing watershed information to aid in better water resource management; inventorying timber to help maintain renewable forest resources; and providing current pictures of urban areas for land use planning.
Other rewarding activities include: gathering global temperature, cloud, moisture, air pressure, wind and other data for better weather and climate forecast; placing domestic aand international communications satellites into their operational orbits; improving observations of near and far space to gain knowledge about the Earth, Solar System, and Universe; experimenting with the manufacture of new and lower cost pharmaceuticals, crystals for electronics, metal alloys, and other products made possible by the weightlessness of space; and transporting technicians and materials to build vast space structures that may be needed for possible future solar electric power stations or for huge communications satellites.
The frequent availability of inexpensive standard cannisters for small self contained payloads makes it possible for students and individual researchers to have their experiments flown on Space Shuttle missions.
Getting into space requires the complex equipment shown on this wallsheet. The Space Shuttle uses the most advanced aerospace technology available to achieve economical and useful space flight.

Summary
Spaceflight, as it now occurs, is characterized by a physiologically restrictive environment. The restrictions are made up of weightlessness, and the extreme isolation encountered by the space traveller.
The first ten years of the space experience have been dedicated to the technical excellence of the spacecraft itself. Very few provisions have been made for the comfort and psychological well being of the space traveller. Perhaps the only reason these missions have been bearable to the astronaut is because of the relative brevity of the missions up to this date. In the future of space travel and manufacture, the environment will have to be very carefully delineated in order to meet the human factor requirements necessary for efficiency in space manufacturing. One very important factor is the relationship of the physical dimension of the human body to the necessary functions it must perform. The single most important factor is the volume requirement per person necessary to make the participants feel comfortable. Presently there are no given generic man/ft^ requirements. In the past, the astronaut was allocated from 300 to 700 ft^. However these requirements were based upon rocket booster capabilities, and not on known habitability requirements.
Human space requirements are not absolute. Norms for individual space have increased historically and are known to vary culturally as a function of industrialization and social affluence. A characteristic has been for luxuries to become necessities, and this has been true in the case of normal and minimum standards for individual space.

Microgravity Background From the beginning of the space program, NASA has had a special interest in the effects of weightlessness. Some of NASA's earliest studies were directed at propellant systems for rockets and structural welding in space. Initially, these studies were conducted in drop towers on Earth. Weightlessness lasted only 5 to 10 seconds. By the mid-1960's, however, the brief periods of weightlessness available in drop towers or on aircraft flights gave way to the longer microgravity experiments of the Apollo program. Microgravity experiments were also conducted on Skylab and the Apollo-Soyuz project, jointly operated by the United States and the U.S.S.R. Most recently, microgravity research has taken place on the space Shuttle. The Space Shuttle opened a new era in microgravity science and applications. While opportunities for reflight and recovery of test samples were available before the Shuttle, the Shuttle permitted larger and more complex experiments than ever before. This combination of heavier payloads and repeated missions allows NASA to expand scientific and commercial research in space. For the 1980's and beyond, space based microgravity research, especially materials processing, will be one of the centerpieces of the U.S. space program.
appendix 6 5

Microgravity Design Considerations
Many space modules will have a microgravity environment. The following are general considerations that must be made when designing the overall layout of the space module for microgravity:
a Access - Microgravity allows greater access to places that would otherwise not be possible in one-g. b. Restraints - Many of the activities in microgravity require that the individual be restrained or tethered. These restraints or tiedowns are not as "portable" as gravity. Layout of crew stations must consider the extra time for the member to secure himself or herself. Activities which require restraints should be grouped as much as possible within the same reach envelope.
(Refer to Paragraph 8.9, Mobility Aids and Restraints Integration, for additional information on restraints and to Paragraph 3.3.3.3.1, Functional Reach Design Requirements, for information on reach limits.)
c. Pre-Mission Training - Training and simulation done on EArth will be conducted in one-g. The design should be such that the transition from Earth to space environment does not completely negate the effects of this training.
d. Work Flow - Although a space module may be at microgravity, one-g rules apply for arrangement and grouping of activity centers for efficient workflow.
appendix 6 6

Microgravity Design Considerations
It is often more efficient to design the workspace so that it can be used for a number of different activities. It may be possible to use a volume which is dedicated to a specific activity and which would otherwise be wasted space when that activity is not being performed. Multipurpose utilization of volume can increase the efficiency of the space module. The activities should be compatible with the surrounding area and with each other. Possible limitations for multipurpose, utilization of a volume include:
a. Hygiene and Contamination - One activity may contaminate another, such as body waste management and food preparation.
b. Time - It may take too much time to efficiently convert the volume from one function to another.
c. Privacy Infringement - An activity may infringe on the privacy of a crew member. This is the main objective to having two persons on different workshifts sharing the same quarters.
The space module must support mixed crews with different skills living and working together in space for months at a time. The design goal of a space module should be to provide a facility that, within some understandably necessary size constraints, provides a comfortable and functionally efficient environment. In order to achieve this goal, consideration must be givin to the physical dimensions of the human. The design must accomodate from the smallest in size to the largest of the selected design crew-member population.
Equipment arrangement, grouping, and layout of the space module should enhance crew interaction and facilitate efficient operation. The module layout
appendix 6 7

Microgravity Design Considerations
and arrangement should be based on detailed analysis using recognized human factors engineering techniques. This analysis process should include the following steps:
a. Functional Definition - Definition of the system functions that must occur in the mission.
b. Functional Allocation - Assignment of these functions to equipment, crew members, and crew stations.
c. Definition of Tasks and Operations - Determination of the characteristics of the crew tasks and operations required to perform the functions, including:
1. Frequency. 2. Duration. 3. Sequence. 4. Volume required. 5. Special environmental requirements. 6. Privacy and personal space requirements.
d. Space Module Layout - Using the information determined above, the layout of the space module should:
1. Minimize the transit time between related crew stations. 2. Accomodate the expected levels of activity at each station. 3. Isolate stations when necessary for crew health, safety, and performance, and privacy.
appendix 6 8

Microgravity Design Considerations
4. Provide a safe, efficient, and comfortable work and living environment.
The following requirements apply to the overall architecture of the space module.
a. Crew Station Size - Each crew station shall be sufficiently large to accomodate the anticipated crew and their activity level. (Refer to Paragraph 8.6, Envelope Geometry for Crew Functions, for detailed requirements.)
b. Transit Time Minimization - Unproductive crew transit times shall be minimized. (Refer to Paragraph 8.7, Traffic Flow, for detailed requirements.)
c. Station Accessibility - Appropriate cues shall be provided for the location and identification of crew stations. Translation Paths and crew station entry and exits shall be sized and located to accomodate anticipated traffic patterns and volume. (Refer to Paragraph 8.5, Location Coding, Paragraph 8.8, Translation Paths, and Paragraph 8.10, Hatches and Doors, for detailed requirements.)
d. Crew Station Location - Stations that perform related funcrions shall be adjacent to each other, if possible. Activities performed at a station shall be compatible with surrounding activities and facilities (i.e. non-interference in terms of physical, visual, or auditory tasks). Crew stations shall be seperated or isolated if it improves the
appendix 6 9

Microgravity Design Considerations
overall performance and or safety of the crewmembers. (Refer to Paragraph 8.3, Crew Station Adjacencies, for detailed requirements.)
e. Microgravity - Appropriate mobility aids, restraints, and orientation cues shall be provided throughout the space module to accomodate living and working when in a microgravity environment.
f. Reconfiguration - The space module shall have design features that minimize expenditure of crew skill and time in the event of space module reconfiguration.
g. Decor and Lighting - The design, decor, and lighting of the space module interior shall be configured to enhance the performance, safety, and comfort of the crewmembers.
h. Dedicated vs. Multipurpose - Space Utilization Design Requirements. The interior accommodations shall be designed so that multipurpose utilization of the space meets the following requirements:
1. Compatibility of the Activities Within Crew Stations Activities that occur within the same station shall not interfere with each other. It is best if the different activities occur at different times.
2. Compatibility With Surrounding Activities and Facilities Each of the activities performed at a station shall be compatible with surrounding activities and facilities.

Site Analysis
Environment can be defined as the summation of the physical and chemical forces acting on materials which are exposed within the boundaries under consideration. This section considers the environment extending from the Earth's upper atmosphere throughout interplanetary space, (see Figure 25)
300
'K
appendix 7 1

Site Analysis The lower atmosphere or troposphere has beeen quite well characterized for many years. The chemistry of this layer is relatively constant but pressure and temperature decline with increasing altititude. The moisture variation in the troposphere coupled with convection forces and winds cause our familiar weather phenomena.
The next atmospheric layer is the stratosphere or region of constant temperature of about -56°C. This is the altitude at which there is significant increase in solar ultraviolet light and an accompanying increase in ozone concentration.
The maximum ozone concentration of about 11 parts per million is found near the stratopause which forms the upper boundary of the stratosphere (about 25 km in middle latitudes). Above this layer lies the mesosphere or first temperature maximum of 0°C. The mesopause forms the atmospheric temperature minimum near -73°C and approximately corresponds to lower layer of the ionosphere. It is also the layer where most meteors bum out and disappear.
The next layer is the thermosphere. Temperatures increase rapidly in this layer until they begin to taper off in the inner layers off the ionosphere and the exosphere.
The space station will be sited approximately 225 miles above sea level. At this level, or altitude, all traces of the Earths' atmosphere are indistinguishable. Meteor activity is at a minimum. Temperatures are determined only by the reflectance coefficient of the material exposed to the exterior. All oxygen and nitrogen have been long since ionized.
appendix 7 2

Site Analysis

The velocity necessary to maintain a circular orbit is 15,120 miles per hour (mach 27). Artificial gravity is determined by the diameter of the spacecraft. Therefore the angular momentum and centripetal acceleration will be computed at the documentation phase of the thesis process, (see Figure 26)

Orientation
This section discusses the orientation of crew stations (workstations, crew activity centers, etc.) within the space module. The information in this section applies to a microgravity environment where there is no gravity to define a single orientation.
In a 1-G or partial gravity environment, orientation is not a particular problem. "Down" is the direction in which gravity acts and the human is normally required to work with feet down and head up. In a microgravity environment, the human working position is arbitrary. There is no gravity cue that defines up or down. In microgravity, orientation is defined primarily through visual cues which are under the control of the system designer. The orientation within a particular crew station is refered to as a local vertical. There are several orientation factors to be considered when designing a microgravity environment.
a. Work Surfaces - Microgravity expands the number of possible work surfaces (walls, ceilings, as well as floors) within a given volume. This could result in a number of different "local verticals" within a module.
b. Training and Testing - Some of the working arrangements that are possible in microgravity will not easily be duplicated on Earth. Pre-mission training and testing will suffer with these arrangements. Additional training might have to be conducted during the actual mission. This could drastically reduce the effectiveness of a short duration mission.
c. Disorientation - Humans, raised in a 1-0 environment, are accustomed to forming a mental image of their environment with a consistent orientation. People locate themselves and obvjects according to
appendix 7 4

Orientation this mental image. If the person is viewing the environment in an unusual orientation, this mental image is not supported. This can promote disorientation, space sickness, temporary loss of direction, and overall decreased performance.
d. Visual Orientation Cues - Visual cues are needed to help the crewmember quickly adjust his or her orientation for a more familiar view of the world. These visual cues should define some sort of horizontal or vertical reference plane (such as the edges of a CRT or window). Of the two, it appears that the horizontal cue is being conducted by Nasa to determine additional guidelines for the design of visual orientation cues.
e. Equipment Operation - Due to prior training and physical characteristics of the human, some pieces of equipment are more efficiently operated in one specific orientation. Labeling must also be properly oriented to be readable. Direction of motion stereotypes exist for most controls. For instance, in the U.S. power is turned on when a switch is positioned "up" or toward the head. If equipment items, labels, and controls have different orientations within the same crew station, human errors are likely to occur.
The following are design requirements for establishing an orientation within a space module:
a. Consistent Verticle Orientation - Each crew station shall have a local verticle so that the verticle orientation within a specific work station or activity center shall remain consistent, (see Figure 45 for illustration).
appendix 7 5

b. Visual Orientation Cue - A visual cue shall be provided to allow the

crewmember to quickly adjust to the orientation of the activity center or

workstation.

c. Seperation - When adjacent workstations or activity centers have verticle orientations differing by 90° or more, then clearly definable demarkations shall separate the two areas.

appendix 7 6

Location Coding
This section discusses the standards for defining locations on or within a space module. The location coding system shall apply to all crew interface areas including:

a. Control and display panels. b. Stowage areas, lockers, subcompartments, and containers. c. Access panels. d. Systems, components, and equipment.

(Refer to Paragraph 9.5, Labeling and Coding, for specific labeling and coding design requirements and considerations.)

Traffic Flow The following analytical process can help to optimize traffic flow and crew functioning:
a. Analyze Functions and Tasks - Determine the type and level of activity that occur at each of the crew stations and the required movement of crew and equipment between the stations.
b. Locate Crew Stations - Locate crew stations to minimize the traffic flow.
c. Design Translation Paths - Once the crew stations are located, design the translation paths for efficient traffic flow. First, design the paths to accomodate the traffic flow requirements of the worst case conditions. Then, complete the design to meet other traffic flow requirements.
1. Define traffic flow details: number of persons, number of transits, type of packages, speed of transit, type of activity surrounding the path, etc.
2. Use the information above and Figure 46 to determine the required translation path.
3. Accomodate possible congestion at intersections through scheduling, increase of path size, provision for visibility of crossing traffic, etc.
appendix 7 8

Aisle diameter approximately same as transported equipment Visibility and use of hands for mobility degraded
Aisle larger trian transported equipment Visibility improved

Traffic Flow

The following factors must be considered in designing for equipment and package transfer in microgravity conditions:
a. Task Constraints - The planning of equipment transfer traffic routes must take into account task constraints such as time, safety requirements, required positioning accuracy, other trafic, and gravity conditions.
b. Translation Path and Equipment Size - A translation path approximately the size of the equipment being transported will degrade visibility and use of hands and feet for translation mobility and stability (see Figure 47)
The design for traffic flow shall take into account the possibility of a space module or subsystem failure or damage that could require evacuation.

Case Study 2

The Skylab Food Management Compartment for a crew of three was

combined with a wardroom (see Figure 8.6.4.1-1). The area measured 2.29

meters (7.5 feet) long by 2.44 meters (8 feet) wide by 1.98 meters (6.5 feet)

high. Total combined habitable volume was 11.1 cubic meters (391 cubic

feet) .This compartment was used by three crewmembers for a mission of 84

days.

The volume of this sleep compartment was satisfactory for a mission of 85 days. The Skylab combined both the waste management and hygiene functions in a single compartment (see Figure 38). The dimensions were 1.98 meters (6.5 feet) long by 0.92 meters (3.0 feet) wide by 1.98 meters (6.5 feet) high. The total combined free volume was 3.57 cubic meters (126 cubic feet). The total habitable volume utilized by the hygiene function was approximately 2.42 cubic meters (85 cubic feet). The total habitable volume utilized by the waste management function was approximately 2.42 cubic meters (85 cubic feet).

The duration of the mission has an overall effect on the required envelope

geometry. Increasing mission duration requires a greater physical envelope to

accomodate mission tasks and personal needs. Figure 40 illustrates this. Crew

accomodations are listed in the general order that their need might occur in a

mission. These accommodations are additive, so the total required habitable

volume per crewmember increases with duration. Guidelines for determining

the amount of habitable volume per crewmember for varying misssion

durations are shown in Figure 41. As the mission duration increases, there is a greater tendency for the crew to feel confined and cramped. This can effect psychological health and crewmember performance. The judged physical space is not

necessarily relative to the

physical size of the room. The feehng of spaciousness can be achieved visually

through the arrangement, color, and design of the walls and partitions of the

space module. Some of the facts that are known about visual spaciousness are

listed below:

a. Distance from Viewer - Errors of overestimation of space increase as
appendU 8 5

Envelope Geometry
the distance from the viewer increases. This indicates desirability of long view axes.
b. Room Shape - Irregular shaped rooms are percieved to have more volume than compact or regular shaped rooms of equal volume.
c. Viewing along a surface - Distances judged along surfaces are overestimated with respect to those judged through empty space. If an observer looks along a wall, the boundary wall would be judged as further away than if it is seen from the same physical distance across the empty space of the room.
d. Lighting and Color - The effects of brightness, color saturation, and illumination levels on perception of volume are listed in Figure 8.6.2.2-1. (Refer to Paragraph 8.12.2, Interior Design and Decor Design Considerations, for details of the effects of lighting and color.)

Envelope Geometry
f. Windows - Windows allow the crewmember to focus on objects (such as Earth) outside the space module. This can significantly increase the sense of spaciousness and psychological well being of the crewmember. (Refer to Paragraph 8.11, Windows Integration, for additional information on the use of windows in architecture.)
Some of the social factors that should be considered in the layout of the interior volume of the space module are discussed below:
a. Privacy - Visual privacy is a major concern for some activities such as body waste management and personal hygiene. Volumes devoted to these functions must be visually isolated. In addition, it has been found that a general sense of privacy increases when visual exposure of the individual decreases and the individual has controllable visual access to the outside world. In other words, the individual feels private if he or she has the ability of observing without being observed. This should be considered when designing individual crew quarters.
b. Leadership Role - The size of and role of a crewmember's private quarters can impart a sense of status to other crewmembers. If desirable for organizational purposes, this fact can be used in configuring the space module.
c. Proximics - Proximics is the study of space as a communication medium. Some of the factors to consider are:
1. When conversational or recreational space is necessary, the space
appendU 8 7

Envelope Geometry should be configured so that the crewmembers can be at distances of 0.5 to 1.2 meters (1.5 to 4.0 feet) and at angles of 90 to 180 degrees from each other. In general, 90 degrees is preferred for casual conversation while 180 degrees is preferred for competitive games or negotiations. 2. Equal relative heights among social conversants should be maintained through spatial configuration and placement of restraints. 3. In a socially communicating group it should be possible for all to position themselves in relatively similiar body orientation and limb location. Maintaining the same verticle orientation is desirable.
appendbc 8 8

Crew Station Adjacencies
Design of any system or facility should be based on the logical sequence and smooth flow of activities that are to occur in the facility. Generally, the most effecient layout is to place crew stations adjacent to each other when they are used sequentially or in close coordination. There are some limitations to these general rules, however. Adjacent positions should not degrade any of the activities in the surrounding stations. General adjacency considerations, beyond simple active flow, are listed and discussed below.
a. Physical Interference - Some crew stations require a high volume of entering and exiting traffic (both personnel and equipment). Placement of these stations adjacent to each other could result in traffic congestion and loss of efficiency.
b. Noise - Activities such as communications, sleeping and rest, and mental concentration are adversely affected by noise. Activity centers generating significant noise levels should not be placed adjacent to those activity centers adversely affected by noise.
(Refer to Paragraph 5.4, Acoustics, for Specific noise tolerance levels for various activities.) c. Lighting - Ambient illumination from one activity center may either interfere with or benefit the activity of a different center. Activities that require illumination will benefit from the "spillover" ambient illumination. Activities adversely effected by light could be:
1. Certain experiments or lab activities such as photographic development.
appendbc 8 9

Crew Station Adjacencies 2. Sleeping. 3. Use of some optical equipment (such as windows) and self illumination displays (such as CRT). (Refer to Paragraph 8.13, Lighting, for further information on lighting.)
d. Privacy - There are cultural and individual requirements that should be considered. Certain personal activities such as sleeping , personal hygiene, waste management, and personnel interactions require some degree of privacy. These private areas should not be placed in passageways or highly congested activity centers.
e. Security - Many of the experiments and production processes will be confidential to a specific industry or organization. These activity centers may require visual, audio, or electrical isolation from the rest of the space module.
f. Vibration - Certain personal activities such as relaxation or sleep, will be disturbed by vibrations and jolts. In addition, many production, experimental, and control functions will require a stable and vibration free platform. Crew stations of these types should be isolated from sources of vibration. (Refer to Paragraph 5.5, Vibrations, for vibration exposure limits.)

appendix 9 7

Interior Design The following are general considerations for the design of the interior decor:
a. Simplicity - Interior design should be simple, i.e., too many colors, complicated visual patterns, large areas of extremely saturated colors or too many fabric variations may result in visual or sensual oversaturation. Such treatment becomes an annoyance to most observers, especially over long periods of exposure.
b. Variety - Extreme simplicity can be carried too far. Drab, singular color or completely neutral color schemes and smooth, untextured surfaces are monotonous and lead to boredom and eventual irritation with the bland quality of the visual environment.
c. Personalization - The ability of a crewmember to personalize certain portions of her or his environment is often a morale booster. This option should be limited to an individual's personal quarters. A simple feature could be a simple bulletin board on which the crewmember could display memorabilia.
d. Maintenance of Decor - Use of a wide variety of colors, textures, materials, and accessories can exaggerate housekeeping, repair, and replacement problems.(refer to Figure 48 for possible color schemes)

Microgravity Countermeasures
The following is a further discussion of these considerations:
a. Mission Duration - This section assumes a mission duration of at least 10 days. For missions less than 10 days, an exercise facility is desirable for crew morale and well-being. The anticipated physiological decrements of a short mission can be countered by compensatory conditioning programs prior to the mission.
b. Multi Facility Function - The effects of microgravity can be counteracted in a number of different facilities in the space module. The primary function of the microgravity countermeasure facility would be to serve as an area for exercise and for strorage of this equipment.
c. Scheduling Capability - The microgravity countermeasures facility should have means to control the type and quantity of countermeasures administered to each crewmember. This would include a means to track the effects of the countermeasure and provisions for revising the countermeasure protocol and/or schedule.
d. Boredom and Crew Productivity - Microgravity countermeasures such as exercise may be boring because of a lack of mental stimulation. The following are ways in which a facility may reduce the boredom and increase the crew productivity:
1. Recreation facilities - provide supplemental facilities for listening to music, news, video entertainment, etc. 2. Social interaction - Locate fixed countermeasure facilities near each other or near points where people are congregated to allow
appendix 101

social integration.

Microgravity Countermeasures

3. Workstation facilities - Add compatible workstation facilities to the countermeasure facilities so that the crewmember can perform productive work while undergoing countermeasure activities.

4. Mobile facilities - Some countermeasure facilities can be made mobile (such as the elasticized body suit) so that they can be used at other crew stations.

e. Facility Location - The following considerations should be made when locating a fixed facility within the space module:

1. Vibration and noise - Some exercise equipment is noisy and causes vibration. This equipment should be isolated from sensitive areas such as crew quarters or sensitive workstations.

2. Personal hygiene area - post exercise whole or part body washing facilities should be close to the countermeasure facility.

3. Galley or potable water dispenser - Liquids should be available for crewmembers during strenuous exercise.

f. Microgravity Considerations - The design of the countermeasure facilities should account for the effects of microgravity. Some of these considerations are listed below:

1. Drying of perspiration - Perspiration will not drip from the body
appendix 1 0 2

Microgravity Countermeasures but will pool on the body and then float into the atmosphere. There should be some way of drying perspiration before it contaminates the module.
2. Convection cooling - In 1-G, warm air around the body will rise providing cooling. In microgravity this will not occur. Ventilation for cooling must be provided through forced air.
3. Debris containment - Debris, such as hair lint, will not fall to the floor where it can be swept up. There must be a means, such as a vacuum system, to collect such material.
The following equipment and supplies shall be provided as microgravity countermeasures:
a. Exercise Equipment - The following exercise equipment shall be provided:
1. Cardiovascular exercise equipment.
2. Muscular strength maintenance exercise equipment - Equipment to maintain strength in major muscle groups that imposes resistive forces from 10 to 300 lb.
3. Skeletal loading equipment.
b. Monitoring Equipment - The following capabilities shall be provided for monitoring the microgravity countermeasure program:
appendix 1 0 3

Microgravity Countermeasures
1. Routine monitoring - The capability shall be provided to monitor the following parameters on a periodic basis:
a) Electrocardiograph output - 1 2 Lead ECG. b) Blood pressure - Automated indirect systolic and diastolic blood pressure. c) Maximal and submaximal oxygen uptake (V02). d) Muscle strength - Muscle strength measurement of major muscle groups.
c. Pharmaceuticals - Pharmacological agents to help maintain homeostasis, counter bone mineral loss, mitigate space motion sickness, or otherwise counter the negative effects of microgravity shall be included in the space medical facility's pharmaceutical inventory.
Exercise facilities shall meet the following environmental requirements:
a. Cooling and Ventilation - Provide cooling and ventilation controls and capacity to handle increased metabolic rate during exercise.
b. Noise and Vibration Control - Control noise and vibration output from exercise facilities to minimize disturbance to other crew stations.
c. Minimize Boredom - Provide an environment to minimize boredom while exercising.
appendix 1 0 4

Microgravity Countermeasures
The following are example design solutions to the microgravity exercise requirements.
a. Strength Exercises - Several devices that utilize an electromagnetic brake or hydraulic mechanism to impose resistance equivalent to those of a 1-G environment have been developed. With a cable/pulley system and proper positioning, all major muscle groups of the body could be exercised (see Figure 10.8.4-1). The exercises include leg extension, military press, bench press, sit-ups and back extensions, plus leg curls, and arm curls; these exercises constitute an exercise for the major muscle groups of the body and should maintain the strength of the arm extensors and leg flexors (which the programs during Skylab 4 failed to do) as well as the arm flexors and leg extensors which were adequately maintained during Skylab 4. The abdominals and back extensors are included because of their importance as antigravity muscle groups for maintaining an erect posture in a 1-G environment. These are not adequately stressed by the natural body position assumed during microgravity exposure.
b. Aerobic Exercise Equipment - A bicycle ergometer similiar to that used in the Skylab series will provide aerobic exercise. It could be modified to include a video display terminal and computer programs (both commercially available) to simulate bicycle touring in Earth environments (through Yellowstone Park, coast to coast, hilly terrain, etc). Data storage, allowing each crewmember to keep performance and status records, should be included. These modifications, while not essential to the physiological performance, will greatly enhance motivation to exercise and adherence to required regimens.

The equipment in the SMF must be operable by the crew members. The final selection and design of the SMF equipment must be consistent with the medical training of the crew.
A SMF is a dedicated space module area that shall be set aside primarily for medical treatment of crewmembers on long term missions. The following detailed equipment parameters are based on current clinically acceptable medical standards. Future advances in clinical medicine may change many of these requirements.
The following communications and computing capabilities shall be provided in the Space Medical Facility:
a. Medical Database - An onboard medical information management system, incorporating an integrated medical database and appropriate levels of medical information security, shall be provided.
b. Private Two-Way Communications - A voice communication channel between SMF and Earth shall be provided to allow crewmembers the opportunity to discuss their health problems/concerns with crew medical officers, NASA physicians, and other concerned personnel.
c. Data Downlink - Data communication channels shall be provided to ensure downlinking of medical information/data to assist ground personnel in determining actual conditions of ill or injured crewmembers.
d. Medical Management Algorithms (Computer Assisted) Preventative, diagnostic, and therapeutic computer assisted medical

Laundry The following are design consideration for space module laundry facilities:
a. Crew Productivity - Laundry processing is a potentially significant use of crew time and every effort should be made to reduce the level of crew involvement. The following are means of reducing crew time:
1. Elimination of the need for pressing laundry.
2. Elimination of the need to sort laundry prior to washing due to different processing requirements.
3. Automation of the collection, processing, and distribution functions.
4. Use of disposable clothing.
b. Laundry Collection, Processing, and Distribution System - There are a number of different options for laundry collection, processing, and distribution. Each of these options require different human factors considerations. Some of these options and their human factors implications are listed below:
1. Central collection, processing, and distribution laundry area This might save overall module volume but could result in loss of crew time to making daily trips to the laundry area.
2. Several small collection points and central processing and distribution area - This would increase module volume devoted to the

laundry function but may improve crew efficiency. An automated transfer of dirty laundry (through conveyor or piping system) would further increase crew efficiency.

3. Several small collection, processing, and distribution areas Would save crew time in collection and distribution but may require more volume and more crew time in actual laundry processing.

c. System Capacity - Clothing types and laundering frequency rates are

estimated in Figure 10.10.2-1. These rates and the size of the crew can be

used to estimate the required capacity of the system. Additional

laundry capacity will be required for towels, washcloths, bedding, etc.

Landering of these items will

depend on the design of the personal hygiene facility, use of disposable materials, housekeeping techniques, etc. Once the system is sized, procedures will have to be established to ensure the laundering frequency

d. Noise - Laundry facilities are a potential source of high noise levels. They must be isolated or insulated as required to ensure that the noise requirements in Paragraph 5.4 are met.

Hygiene
The following are considerations to be made in the design of personal hygiene facility:
a. Psychological Effects - Good grooming can enhance self image, improve moral, and increase the productivity of the crewmember. Adequate and comfortable bathing and body waste management facilities have been high on the list of priorities of participants in various space missions. Some modification of personal hygiene practices and procedures may be necessary due to equipment design limitations and water supply restrictions. Too great a modification, however, could impact negatively on crew self image and productivity. It would be unwise to expect optimum performance unless optimum conditions are provided.
b. Odor - Objectionable body odors can rapidly build without adequate personal hygiene facilities. This is a predictable source of interpersonal conflict.
c. Ease and Comfort of Use - The personal hygiene facilities will not be used, or will be used infrequently, if they are awkward, uncomfortable, or take an inordinate amount of time to use. This was a problem with the Skylab shower design.
d. Privacy - It is desirable to have privacy for crewmembers for whole body and partial body cleaning (including donning and doffing of clothing).
e. Feedback - Unfamiliar and inadequate facilities and environment can
appendix 1 1 3

Hygiene
result in crewmembers falling into patterns of substandard hygiene. The results are likely to be reduced productivity and interpersonal conflict. Provision of full length mirrors or other means of feedback can help to maintain personal image and hygiene habits.
f. Mission Duration - Shorter missions generally require less extensive personal hygiene facilities. Each of the facility design requirement paragraphs provide guidelines for determining facility requirements based on mission duration.
g. Microgravity Considerations:
1. Cleanup - in microgravity, water and debris, such as hair, do not fall to a fixed surface as they do on Earth. Water and debris float. Water cannot be simply drained away and hair cannot be swept up. Collection of water and debris become bodi an engineering problem and an operational problem for the crew member. Functions that require relatively little time on Earth, such as a shower, can require much more time and be less relaxing because of the cleanup requirements due to microgravity. This can impact negatively both on mission schedule and personal motivation to use the facilities. Designs should minimize the time and discomfort penalties resulting from microgravity.
2. Restraints - Restraints should be provided so that the crewmember does not compromise the personal hygiene operations by having to stabilize himself or herself. These restraints should be compatible with the personal hygiene operation. For example, foot

restraints in a whole body wash facility should not be damaged when exposed to water.

Foam Steel Some of the benefits of materials processing are the new developments that arise from government sponsored research. These benefits include new technologies and new materials. One of the most extraordinary new materials is "foam steel". Collectively these materials are known as fiber reinforced composite materials.
Some of the strength adding elements are boron or graphite, and "whiskers" needle shaped single crystals.
These materials could make possible a skyscraper one mile high, (if one is necessary) or a suspension bridge twice as long as the ones now in existence. Airplane weights can be reduced by as much as one third, allowing light weight, faster, more fuel efficient aircraft.
Ironically, these materials are slated to be the workhorses of the space station structural systems. The irony of these materials is that they can only be produced in microgravity (presently these materials are being processed in drop tubes and KC-135 aircraft flying parabolic trajectories).
The production of these materials are possible due to directional cooling, or directional solidification. The space station will be a regenerative process to an extent, in that it will produce the materials to allow itself to grow and expand in capabilities and physical scale.

General Purpose Rocket Furnace

Experimental Capability The General Purpose Rocket Furnace (GPRF) provides three independently controlled cavities for melting and resolidifying experimental specimens in a microgravity environment. Each cavity can be operated to provide near-isothermal or gradient temperature profiles. Samples can be cooled at specific rates with a cold gas quench through a common manifold or water-cooled heat sink integral with each cavity while maintained in a sealed atmosphere.

Mode of Operation Each cavity consists of a three zone furnace with heat extraction at one end, capable of operating in an isothermal or gradient mode. The temperature gradient is maintainedby programmable control of the three heating elements and a heat exchanger in the cavity. The isothermal environment is provided by operating the three heating elements at or as near the same temperature as possible.

Facility Integration Options Presently the GPRF is designed to operate in the Materials Experiment Assembly (MEA) in the Orbiter payload bay.

Additional Notes NASA plans to modify the two GPRF's to increase their operating time and temperature capability after the MEA-A3 (D-1) Mission which is scheduled in the latter part of 1985.

Advanced Automated Directional Solidification Furnace

Experimental Capability This advanced design of a directional solidification furnace (AADSF) has a sophisticated controlled gradient region between the hot and cold zones. The furnace may be configured to an individual experimenter's sample and operated to compensate for changes in solidus temperature as the sample adjusts to its steady state value, changes in thermal conductivity between solid and melt, and energy deposition from translation and release of latent heat. The unit is capable of maintaining the solidification front in optimum postition for obtaining a nearly planar interface.

Mode of Operation The microprocessor controlled gradient region consists of one or more wafer thin booster heaters, an adjustable length adiabatic zone, and a controllable heat sink. The booster heaters and the use of a heat transfer medium between the sample and the heating module provide much steeper thermal gradients than conventional Bridgeman furnaces in the solidification region. The furnace thereby allows stabilization of the interface against constitutional breakdown.

Isoelectric Focusing Experiment
Experimental Capabilty This apparatus was developed to determine the best isoelectric colunm configuration for a recycling isoelectric focusing ^ l E F ) apparatus designed for operation in low-g. Ground-based RIEF is possible only through the use of screen elements which assure laminarity of flow by minimizing electro-osmosis and limiting convection. The isoelectric focusing experiment contains eight column assemblies. The first use of the apparatus had columns with different combinations of three kinds of partitions, two kinds of buffers, and one kind of antielectro-osmosis coating.

Mode of Operation Seventy volts direct current is simultaneouosly applied across (end-to-end) each colunm to produce a pH gradient in the buffer and focusing of the materials to be separated. Movement of the colored samples to their isoelectric points (the point where the pH of the sample and the pH of the buffer are the same) is recorded photographically.

Single Axis Acoustic Levitator

Experimental Capability The single Axis Acoustic Levitator (SAAL) is a containeriess processing facility using an interface technique to automatically adjust for changes in the speed of sound as the temperature changes. Samples are injected into a hot-wall furnace that can be heated up to 1600°C in an atmospheric environment. After melting, the sample is solidified by allowing it to radiate in an acoustically transparent heat sink. Additional samples may be processed sequentially. The specimen can be positioned without physical means by a weak acoustic levitator and operated automatically following activation. The apparatus is useful for studying the containeriess formation of glasses, ceramics, or other materials that require the presence of an inert atmosphere.

Mode of Operation The sample is positioned in the acoustic energy node formed by the interference of the incident sound wave with the wave reflected from a sniall reflector inserted into the insulated chamber with the sample. Four silicon carbide heating rods surround the levitated sample during the melt phase, and an array of stainless steel rods are inserted into the heating cavity to aUow radiative cooling and solidification. The solidified sample is then retrieved by a retracting cage and another sample automatically inserted. A quartz window serves as a port for photography of the specimen during the processing sequence.

Automated Directional Solidification Furnace

Experimental Capability The Automated Directional Solidification Furnace (ADSF) is used to individually melt up to four different material samples. Each sample can then be cooled at a controlled rate with 50/50 ethylene glycol/water in a manner which will promote directional solidification. Up to two rate changes can be achieved during the processing of each sample. The process allows investigation into the anisotropic properties of metals and the unusual electrical, magnetic, and optical properties of unique directionally solidified molecular structures.

Mode of Operation Four separate furnace heating units are present, consisting of an individual heater module and copper quench block. Each heating unit is translated along the axis of the sample during the melt process. The drive system is variable speed with microprocessor control of the translation speed and any required rate change. Atmospheric and environmental control are maintained by the sealed furnace enclosure.

Continous Flow Electrophoresis System
Experimental Capability This system has been developed to permit exploratory separations of biological materials. The cell handling facilities allow the separation of living cells as well as macromolecules. A large cross section chamber permits a high continuous rate of flow, consequently increasing the potential process volume of the sample material. Sample temperature can be maintained for several hours, permitting the recovery of living cells.

Mode of Operation The sample is injected into the electrophoresis chamber and carried into an electric field by the buffer. Under the influence of the field, in microgravity, the various subfractions of the sample are deflected according to their respective mobilities and enter a channel collector at the end of the chamber. Ideally each fraction segregates into a different channel where it is then moved through tubing by a peristaltic pump to collection bags in a thermally controlled chamber.

Static Column Electrophoretic Seperator
Experimental Capability Up to eight column asemblies can be operated and photographed in each apparatus. A constant voltage (nominally 70 vdc) power supply in the apparatus is used to apply potential to a maximum of eight columns. The output of the 70 vdc power supply is 40 ma. Once the apparatus is manually turned on, it operates for 90 minutes and then shuts itself off. During the 90 minutes of operation, 35 mm photographs are taken once every three minutes for the first 10 frames, and then once every two minutes for 30 frames. This photography sequence can be changed by changing the time-and-control printed circuit board assembly. Columns which require no power can be flown without modification of the apparatus. The multi-output power supply would have to be modified to provide different column voltage and/or current. The meter printed circuit board assembly has nine light emitting diodes (LED) on it that are turned on when each photograph is taken. One LED displays the potential applied to all columns, and the remaining eight display the current passing through each column.

Mode of Operation Each column contains a mixture of a buffer solution and ampholytes to be separated. Once the 70 vdc is applied to each column assembly, the buffer astablishes a pH gradient. Each ampholyte to be separated has its own pH. It migrates to the point in the buffer solution where it and the solution have the same pH, which is known as its isoelectric point (pi).

Three Axis Acoustic Levitator

Experimental Capability This Three Axis Acoustic Levitator (3AAL) apparatus permits a liquid specimen to be positioned and manipulated by a three-dimensional acoustic energy well. Manipulations include rotation, oscillation and drop fusion/fission. The oscillation and rotation can be used to stir the liquid as well as center the gas bubbles in the liquid drop. Multiple samples can be injected and controlled while color or black and white motion pictures are obtained, which provide one direct view and two reflected views on orthogonal axes. Temperature, acoustic pressure and driver power can be monitored. The apparatus permits the investigation of a variety of fluid dynamic properties and particle interaction.

Mode of Operation Three acoustic drivers positioned along orthogonal axes are used to suspend the droplet in an acoustical energy wall. Pulsing or phasing of the drivers permits controlled oscillation or rotation. An injector deploys the liquid sample into the containment area with low velocity and little circulation within the liquid. The primary data recorder is a 16mm movie camera which employs a mirror system to obtain a three view record. Synchronized strobe lights allow the investigator to obtain either a color or a black and white rendition of the experimental sequence.

Acoustic Containeriess Experiment System

Experiment Capability The Acoustic Containeriess Experiment System (ACES) is a flight facility that will melt and acoustically oscillate a single sample of glass, ceramic, or metal while it is acoustically restrained within the central area of a resistance heated rectangular furnace filled with an inert gas. The experiment is monitored by thermal sensors and a video recording system during the 120 minute duration which provides about 15 minutes at the present limitation of 620° C.

Mode of Operation The furnace is an insulated resistance heated Inconel chamber of 6.3 by 6.3 by 7.0 cm internal dimensions. The energy of the three acoustic drivers enters the chamber through three orthagonal ports and forms resonant standing waves within the chamber to restrain sample excursions from the effects of external g perturbations. Resonant frequency is tracked through the chamber temperature changes and adjusted to maintain resonance and sample location control. Rotation and oscillation of the sample can be programmed into the experiment

Fluids Experiment System
Experimental Capability The Fluids Experiment System (FES) is a multi-purpose fluids research facility used to investigate crystal growth phenomena in microgravity through utilization of the grown crystal and holographic records of the growth process. It can accommodate a variety of experimental cells for performing a broad range of fluid experiments in areas such as fluid convection, phase transition, surface physics, and bubble behavior. Samples can be processed for post-flight analysis, and real time flow visualization can be obtained using a schlieren technique. The facility will allow confirmation of the advantages of microgravity environment and evaluation of the feasibility of producing solution grown crystals on orbit.
Mode of Operation The system includes an optical bench for making holograms of a test cell from two orthogonal views. Real time viewing in schlieren or shadowgraph modes is provided by means of a video degree of saturation at the growth interface. Composition profiles can be mapped using holographic interferometry. The system is designed to be used in combination with the Vapor Crystal Growth System (VCGS) and, as such, provides support to the VCGS for microprocessor control, and data acquisition, display and transmission.

Vapor Growth Crystal System
Experimental Capability The Vapor Growth Crystal System (VGCS) is a special purpose facility emulating vapor crystal growth ground experimentation hardware, providing both the grown crystal and in-flight microscopic observation of the growth process via closed circuit television. The apparatus is useful in comparing the stiiictural and spectrographic properties of microgravity grown crystals with Earth grown crystals to determine low-g growth effects. It meets the objective of growing single crystals by vapor transport while inhibiting polycrystalline nucleation.

Mode of Operation The VCGS furnace contains three separate heating elements. The growth ampoule contains a temperature controlled pedestal which positions and controls the seed temperature. Source material for the vapor transport process is positioned on the ampoule sidewall. A binocular microscope is used by the Payload Specialist to monitor the growth process and modify the growth parameters as required. The VCCJS is designed to be used in conjunction with the Fluids Experiment System (FES) and relies on the FES for support in the areas of data entry/display, process control, and power control/distribution.

Solute Diffusion Apparatus

Experimental Capabilities The Solute Diffusion Apparatus can keep liquid reactant solutions separated until established in earth orbit, and then open the valves separating them to allow the solutions to diffuse together slowly and react chemically to form single crystals without gravitational effects. The apparatus can control and record the temperature of the solutions and provide for their thermal expansion or contraction. The solution volumes are variable.

Mode of Operation The apparatus consists of four cylindrical reactors surrounded by a cylindrical resistance heater in an insulated cylindrical enclosure and a microcomputer in a separate cylindrical enclosure. Each reactor has three compartments. The two outer compartments contain the reactant solutions and are designed to cause virtually no stirring when they are opened. The microcomputer controls the entire process, including control and recording of the temperature and opening of the valves. Electric power is supplied by batteries.

The Need
The idea that people other than highly trained astronauts would someday live and work in space has long fascinated science ficUon fans. Today it interests professional space scientists and engineers as well. The Space Shuttle, in which anyone in ordinary good health can ride into orbit, was the first step in turning this dream into reality. The Space Station, planned for initial operation in the 1993-1994 time frame, will provide a permanent facility in orbit for continuing technical and scientific work. It will be operated by rotating crews from Earth, including personnel who are not career astronauts.
The Space Shuttle takes much larger crews into orbit than any prior launch vehicle. The work these crews perform varies greatly, according to the particular mission. Some tasks are similiar to those done every day on Earth, but most are unique to the requirements of spaceflight. Early missions were devoted primarily to verifying the performance of the Space Shuttle and its associated equipment. Crews on later flights have operated instruments to perform extensive observations of the Earth, studied objects of interest in astronomy, processed materials in microgravity, and performed biological experiments with seeds, plants, insects and small animals. A very important part of the work has been launching satellites for scientific and commercial use, and repairing spacecraft in orbit. Some satellites have been recovered from orbit and returned to the ground, ready to be refurbished and launched again.
The Space Shuttle and the Space Station are the largest components in NASA's Space Transportation System, of STS. The system will eventually include other small reusable vehicles and stations as well. The Space Station is now in the design phase, and should be operational by 1994. The first of two small reusable support vehicles tiiat will be used in conjunction with the Space
appendix 1 4 7

Station is also in work.

The Need

The private sector is also working on a space facility. Bell and Trotti, a Houston based architectural firm have joined with Westinghouse earlier this year to build and launch the Industrial Space Facility, the first privately owned space facility. The ISF is scheduled to go into orbit in 1992, a full two years before the NASA space station goes up. NASA has promised to donate two and a half payloads of cargo space on the next available Space Shuttle flights to Space Industries, and is allowing the company to pay on credit. Perhaps one of the important questions that must be asked is, Why in Space? Just as materials processing on Earth made the leap into space a reality, the space program today offers unique opportunities for materials processing. The most important benefit of processing in space is extended weightlessness. On Earth, gravity causes materials of different densities and temperatures to separate and materials to deform under their own weight. In the microgravity of an orbiting spacecraft, however, scientists can use unique materials processing techniques, techniques that are all but impossible on Earth. The results may lead to a material or a processing approach of scientific or commercial value. Among the commercial, scientific, and military benefits of space-based processing are:

Electronic Materials (crystals). Pure, nearly perfect crystals are required in computers, lasers, and numerous other optical and electronic devices. Space processing permits crystal purity and uniformity far beyond those possible on Earth.
Metals, glasses, and ceramics. High-strength metals and temperature-resistant glasses and ceramics are essential to power generation,
appendix 1 4 8

The Need
propulsion, aviation, aerospace, and related applications. Containeriess processing in space permits scientitsts to mix and solidify metals and ceramics in forms and at levels of purity that cannot be obtained on Earth and offers a better understanding of solidification processes on Earth.
Biological materials. Seperation of macro-molecules (proteins, enzymes, cells and cell components) is fundamental to all fields of biological research. Weightiess processing permits scientists to separate and purify biological materials more effectively than can be done on Earth.
Fluids and chemicals. Virtually every physical science depends on an understanding of the effects of gravity on convection, buoyancy, sedimentation, and the like. Investigations of fluid physics and combustion processes under weightiessness can help reveal subtie interactions among atoms and molecules that are not observable under normal gravity. The field of materials research has always been hindered by gravity induced disturbances that restrict observation and limit understanding and control of pertinent phenomena occurring a gaseous or a liquid phase. Thermal gradients in molten materials give rise to gravity driven convection currents which, in turn, prevent solidifying materials from attaining the desired structure and composition. Gravity also intrudes in other ways: it creates hydrostatic pressure, causing hot materials to deform under their own weight; it distorts wetting and surface tension effects; and it causes seperation of materials having different densities. Although use is commonly made of high acceleration fields such as in centrifugal seperation of fluids, very littie attention has been paid to material processes in an environment of less than one gravity. Microgravity (weightlessness) occurs in free-fall in our Earth environment. Environmental
appendix 1 4 9

The Need
factors such as temperature and pressure are controlled and used in materials processing. They are applied at much higher and lower values than are naturally available at the Earth's surface. Variations in gravity, on the other hand, have been used only at higher values because microgravity has been difficult to attain. Some microgravity experimentation has been performed with promising results. For example, it has been demonstrated that crystals grown in microgravity can be more uniform in compositionand, in some circumstances, freer of defects than crystals grown in otherwise comparable conditions on the ground.
appendix 1 5 0

Materials Processing Background
Materials Processing is one of the central elements of NASA's microgravity program. A simple definition cannot adequately explain the term. Materials processing is the conversion of sand to silicon crystals for use in semiconductors. It is the separation of ordinary biological materials into invaluable drugs and chemicals. It is the production of high-strength, temperature resistant alloys and ceramics. It is, in short, the science of processing ordinary and comparatively low-valued raw materials into crystals, chemicals, metals, ceramics, and countless other manufactured products.
Materials processing enables us to build modern computers to process information and communication systems to transmit it. Materials processing enables us to build turbines for aircraft and electric power plants. Materials processing makes possible revolutionary advances in the production of chemical and biological compounds, such as insulin. And, not surprisingly, materials processing, by producing high-strength alloys and heat resistant ceramic tiles, makes the space program possible.
Just as materials processing on Earth made the leap into space a reality, the space program today offers unique opportunities for materials processing. The most important benefit of processing in space is extended weightiessness. On Earth, gravity causes matrials of different densities and temperatures to separate and materials to deform under their own weight. In the microgravity of an orbitting spacecraft, however, scientists can use unique materials processing techniques, techniques that are all but impossible on Earth. The result may lead to a material or a processing approach of scientific or commercial value.

appendix 1 o 2

Biological Materials Background
One of the most exciting areas of microgravity research is biological materials processing. Processing biological materials typically requires separating specific cells, cell components, antigens, hormones, and proteins from a biological medium.
On Earth, one of the most widely used analytical technologies is electrophoresis. In electrophoresis, a gel or another supporting medium is used to suppress convective flows. Small batches of materials are separated by differences in net electrical charge, size and shape. Positive and negative potentials are applied to either end of a medium containing the materials to be separated. As the electrical potentials are applied, materials migrate through a gel or other supporting media toward the attracting potential. Scientists can concentrate some of the desired materials.
To extend this process to a preperative scale or apply it to cells, cell components, or other particles, the supporting media must be eliminated. Such "free-flow" electrophoresis techniques have met with limited success on Earth because of gravity driven convective flows, which tend to remix the separated components.
In space, the convective flows are virtually eliminated. Separation techniques such as continuous flow electrophoresis (CFE) permit separation of biological materials in quantities and levels of purity unattainable on Earth.
In CFE, which is efficient only in a weightiess ennvironment, a continuous flow of biological material is separated. Without the effects of gravity to distort the separation process or the separation medium, gels or other
appendix 1 5 3

Biological Materials Background
supporting media are no longer required. Larger quantities of purer materials can be produced. Cells and cell components that would not pass through the pores of the gell can be separated in space by this process. The potential commercial benefit of space-based CFE is sufficient that a U.S industrial consortium has already sponsored a commercial CFE experiment aboard the Shuttie.
The potential benefits from weightless electrophoresis and other biological materials processing techniques are enormous.
The importance of biological materials processing in space can be understood by considering the quantities and values of desired materials. On Earth, many essential biological materials can be produced only in gram or millgram quantities and then only at costs of tens of thousands of dollars per unit. The value of these materials per unit of weight and the ability to produce greater quantities in the weightiess environment of space mean that commercial-scale production in space may prove to be very economical. In addition to commercial-scale production of proven materials, space offers the opportunity for extended research into new and promising biological techniques commercially unattainable in the gravity on Earth.
appendix 1 5 4

Electronic Materials Background
Crystals are at the heart of the electronic revolution. Crystals, made of sisicon or other materials, are the basis of semiconductors, computers, radiation sensors, and lasers. Crystals enable us to operate satellites for worldwide communications, weather recoimaisance, and military surveillance. Crystals allow us to explore frontiers ~ for example, artificial intelligence ~ that were once thought unreachable.
The structure and purity of the crystals that support these technologies are remarkable. Inpurities measured in the parts per billion can render a cryatal useless. Structural defects at the molecular level can have the same effect. On Earth, these problems are partially overcome only with complex and costly processes for growing crystals and obtaining the desired electrical properties. Space offers at least two highly desirable conditions for crystal growth:
*Weightlessness permits scientists to grow large, nearly perfect crystals. Gravity-driven flows that deform the face of the growing crystal or distort the crystallizing zone are absent in a weightiess environment.
*In a weightless environment, objects like crystals can be processed without a containerm Containeriess processing permits scientists to melt and solidify crystals without the crystals absorbing impurities from a container. Metals, glasses, and ceramics If crystals provide the electronic basis for the future, metals, glasses, and ceramics provide the structural bases. Advanced metals, glasses, and ceramics are essential to such products as jet engines, nuclear power plants, electro-optical devices, and the Space Shuttle itself.
appendix 1 5 5

Electronic Materials Background
In the case of the Space Shuttie, for examble, the heat of reentry (up to 3,000°F) is enough to destroy every metal known. The solution? A ceramic made of silica fibers, offering exceptional heat resistance. When formed into a tile at high temperature and low pressure, the silicon fiber becomes a low density solid that resists the heat of reentry. Such ceramics offer a wide range of opportunities for high-temperature applications.
Where high temperatures are combined with high stress, however, ceramics can crack. For these types of applications, including the turbine blades of jet engines, special metals are needed. These metals are cast under exacting conditions to ensure the precise structure recquired.
The weightlessness of space offers scientists an opportunity to investigate and improve the methods for creating advanced metals, glasses, and ceramics. While no one expects giant space foundries to turn out quantities of manufactured products in the near future, scientists do expect this research to uncover compounds whose properties are of great value.
Another important benefit of space processing may be the development of lower-attenuation glass fiber for use in the optical communication systems, these fibers would allow more signals to be sent over a longer distance than do conventional fibers.
Among the important methods that could benefit from weightlessmess is directional solidification. Under directional solidification, metals can be given enhances properties along a preferred direction. For applications that place a great strain on the metal in a known direction, as in a jet turbine, directionally solidified metals are invaluable.
appendix 1 5 6

Electronic Materials Background Another important process that can be studied extensively in space is rapid undercooling. In this process, a metal is solidified so rapidly that its atoms caimot organize themselves into their normal metallic structure. The result, a disordered structure similiar to that of glass, gives the material unusual properties. This process, studied in space, is advancing casting technology on Earth.

thesis statement

Proposal

Architecture is the physical embodiment of the spirit of the need it serves. Architecture is a servant of mankind. At its best it serves to inspire and instill civic identity.

The built enviroimient is the culmination of technology, cultural aesthetic, and personal values. Architecture is a planned, carefully conceived integration of the built environment and these expressions. When the spirit is present, architecture becomes something which is bigger than life; regardless of its scale. Architecture can never provide the "spirit", but intrinsically presents a medium for the clear transmission and enhancement of the "spirit".

Because architecture is not limited to just 'places' for activities it affects us on every scale - from the design of the key ring for our car, to the road system which moves us into the city we eat, sleep, and play in. Architecture is intuitively obvious only to the most passionate observer.

thesis proposal
The spirit of twenty-first century america is best described as one of competitive internationalism. And in no other facet of american life is this competitive drive more intense than in the American Space Program. The space shuttle is a necessary first step toward permanently manned space stations. The space shuttle will serve as the building platform for an orbitting pharmaceutical research and manufacturing lab in space. This facility will explore the possibility for the advancement and production of medical and pharmaceutical materials. Due to tiie prohibitive costs involved in the
appendix 1 5 8

Proposal
transport of people and materials, this facility will have to serve as a community for interrelated researchers, engineers, and medical technicians. The need for an architectural solution to the problems encountered in a dehumanized environment is enormous. We can not abandon this field to depersonalized functionally trained engineers. The persons involved in the activities of this research and manufacturing facility most be afforded all the benefits of a well planned city.
programming strategies
I will pursue the research for this thesis program in two major directions. Because of the fantasy nature of this project and the possibilities of exploring new twenty-first century technologies, much of my research will be done by personal correspondence with science fiction writers. I am currently attempting to obtain any technical material available from the Institute for Future Studies, (a NASA sponsored student program). The technical portion of the pharmaceutical research will be done with the help and guidance of the faculty and students of the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center.
I look forward to the possibilities and opportunities this proposal will give me. The fantasy and technological aspects of this project will be the best possible vehicle for the advancement of my thesis; Architecture is the physical embodiment of the spirit of the need it serves, the need is a vehicle for the enhancement of America's competitive internationalism.

Shuttle Background
At present, the principle means of conducting orbittal research is via NASA's Space Shuttie. Experiments aboard the shutttie may be conducted in the middeck area of thee Orbitter cabin, in the cargo bay, using either the Materials Science Laboratory; and in the Spacelab module. Each of tiiese Shuttle payload ares offer certain special characteristics.
Middeck payloads are carried in one or more of the 42 middeck storage lockers, each about 2 cubic feet in size with a maximum experiment weight of 60 pounds. Crew involvement with middeck experiments is possible.
Payloads using the Materials Experiment Assembly are self-contained and operate independentiy of the Shuttie itself. Payloads on the Materials Science Laboratory (MSL) use the resources provided by the Orbiter. The experiments can be large (up to 12 cubic feet [on an upcoming flight] and heavy (up to 2,100 pounds [on the same flight]). The total weight of the experiments in the laboratory is more than 3,300 pounds.
Spacelab experiments are similiar to MSL experiments in size and character, except that the crew can be more involved in experiments conducted in the Spacelab module. As Spacelab missions evolve, it is expected that each will be dedicated to a specific scientific discipline, such as materials processing, life sciences, or environmental observations. Use of dedicated discipline laboratories will reduce flight costs and intergration requirements and will permit increased coordination among experimenters.
Apparatus and equipment available or under development for these experiments include many types of furnaces for crystal growth and directional solidification, electrophoresis equipment, acoustic levitators, fluid experiment
appendix 1 6 0

Shuttle Background
systems, and vapor crystal growth systems. Several of these systems are intergated into Spacelab racks and provide advanced multiuser processing. If the existing equipment and apparatus are not suitable for an experiment, investigators may build their own, using a low-cost approach made possible by the Shuttie's opportunities for reflight.
Recent accomplishments in NASA's Microgravity Science and Applications program range from theoretical to ground investigations to large experiments aboard the Shuttie. The June 1983 flight of the Shuttie carried six microgravity experiments: three sponsored by the United States and three sponsored by West Germany. The U.S. experiments are:
Containeriess processing of glass. Glass samples were injected into a furnace, positioned by accoustic pressure, melted, and cooled. This containeriess processing method can be used to better understand glass formation and to improve glasses for optical and electrical applications.
Miscibility-gap materials. An immiscible alloy is a mixture that separates rapidly under gravity. Before the molten metals solidify, density differences cause the less dense metal to float on the denser metal. The miscibilty problem for metals is very much like trying to mix two common liquids, oil and water. In the zero gravity of space, however, immiscible metals can be alloyed with the desired distribution constituents and studied. Such new alloys may lead to improved structural, electrical, and magnetic materials.
Among the German-sponsored experiments, two involved miscibility gap alloys and one involved solidification of composite materials. The fact that foreigh governments and U.S commercial investigators are willing to pay to
appendix 161

Shuttle Background develop the experiments they fly aboard the Shuttie indicates its importance to microgravity research. Continuous flow electrophoresis. A recent commercial microgravity experiment, the Mcdonnell Douglass continuous flow electrophoresis, is being watched closely by other researchers. This experiment offers the potential for commercial production of biological materials, such as pharmaceuticals, in space. NASA plans continued space based research to refine and improve biological separation techniques for potential applications.
Over the next 5 to 10 years, microgravity research will stress both scientific and commercial goals. Products will include crystals, metals and ceramics, glasses, and biological materials. Processes will include containeriess processing and fluid and chemical transport. As research in these areas develops, the benefits will become increasingly apparent on Earth: new materials, more efficient use of Earth's nonrenewable fuel resources, new pharmaceuticals, advanced computers and lasers, and better communications. Like space, the opportunities offered by microgravity science and applications are vast and are only beginning to be explored. The NASA program will evolve over the next decade to take maximum advantage of our planned Space Station capability.
